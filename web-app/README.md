# Beanjamin Web App

Customer-facing kiosk UI for the Beanjamin espresso robot. Built with Next.js and communicates with the robot via the Viam TypeScript SDK.

## Routes

- `/` — fleet dashboard. Lists machines accessible to the logged-in user with a live per-machine queue summary, plus order charts and leaderboards. Each row offers two links: the row itself opens the kiosk in **standard mode**, and a `[kiosk mode →]` link opens it in **kiosk mode**. A status dot precedes each machine name:
  - 🟢 **green** — online and the coffee-lifecycle service is answering.
  - 🟡 **yellow** — online and reachable, but the machine isn't running the coffee-lifecycle service.
  - ⚪ **gray** — offline.
- `/machine?partId=<partId>` — kiosk for a specific robot part. The `partId` is resolved to an FQDN via `appClient.getRobotPart` and the kiosk connects directly to the machine.

### Query parameters

- `partId` — the robot part to connect to (required for real connections).
- `kiosk=1` — kiosk mode: hides the "← Back to Fleet Dashboard" link on the welcome and order-confirmation screens. Use when the page is the only thing on screen and you don't want customers navigating away.
- `name` / `email` — prefill the kiosk's name and email fields, e.g. `&name=Ada&email=ada@example.com`. The fields stay editable, and are reset to these values after each order. A face-recognized returning customer still takes precedence.
- `clearAfterSec` — how long, in seconds, nobody may be recognised on the welcome screen before the "Welcome back" greeting and the prefilled name and email clear. Defaults to 2. It is counted in camera checks (see `identifyIntervalMs`), so it is rounded up to a whole number of them.
- `identifyIntervalMs` — how often, in milliseconds, the welcome screen asks the machine who is at the camera. Defaults to 1000, minimum 250. Each check captures a frame and runs the face model, so a smaller value means more load on the machine.
- `mock=1` / `mock=0` — see dev-mode rules below.

## Running locally

Requires Node.js 20.20.2 or later.

Install dependencies (from `web-app/`):

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On localhost without a `userToken` cookie, the app runs in **dev/mock mode** — no real robot connection needed. The home page shows an "Open dev kiosk" button that opens the kiosk against a simulated queue.

### Dev/mock mode rules

Defined in [`app/lib/viamClient.ts`](app/lib/viamClient.ts):

- No `userToken` cookie → dev mode (forced).
- `userToken` cookie present:
  - `?mock=1` → dev mode
  - `?mock=0` → real mode
  - default → real mode

The dev-kiosk button always appends `?mock=1` so it works whether or not a `userToken` is set on the origin.

## Connecting to a real robot

The kiosk authenticates via an `access-token` parsed from the `userToken` cookie set by Viam's web app on its own origin. To connect to a real machine, serve the app from an origin where that cookie is set — typically by:

- **Deploying as a Viam module** (the production path).
- **Tunneling localhost through a domain that has the cookie** (e.g. for end-to-end testing against a real robot from your dev machine). The tunnel domain is what `window.location.hostname` reads, so the app behaves as a deployed instance on that origin.

Run the following and go to http://localhost:8012 to get the cookie. 
```bash
viam module local-app-testing --app-url http://localhost:3000
```

## Pose calibration view

`?view=calibrate&partId=<partId>` shows which poses belong to which frame on a
given machine. Reached from the fleet dashboard: each row links to
its own machine as `[poses →]`, shown only for machines the manifest covers. A
`partId` that isn't in the manifest says so rather than quietly showing a
different machine's poses.

It shows which poses belong to which frame on a given machine,
and which of them are set by hand versus derived from another pose. At the top
it polls where the machine believes `filter`, `grip-point`, and `cam` currently
are — the same reading as `viam robot part motion get-pose` — each with a copy
button. That is the loop: jog the arm, copy the live frame, paste it into one of
the poses listed for that frame.

The live readout needs the machine online and a `userToken` cookie; without one
it falls back to dev mode. The pose list itself comes from a generated manifest,
so regenerate it whenever a pose is added, removed, renamed, or re-baselined:

```bash
make web-app-manifest                          # refresh the machines already in it
make web-app-manifest PART_IDS="<id> <id>"     # add or change machines
```

`viam login` is the only setup. The page always warns that the list may be out
of date — it shows the capture time and how long ago that was, and escalates
past 30 days, but never claims the list is current, because nothing in the page
can detect a pose change.

## Other commands

```bash
npm run build        # static export → web-app/out/
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # unit tests (node:test)
```

From the repo root:

```bash
make web-app-dev          # dev server (npm run dev)
make web-app-local-test   # serve it through a Viam origin so the userToken cookie is set
make web-app-test         # unit tests
make web-app-install      # npm ci, after a dependency change
make web-app-module       # bundled Viam module (web app + Go launcher)
```

`make web-app-local-test` wraps the `viam module local-app-testing` command
above; run it alongside `make web-app-dev` and open
[http://localhost:8012](http://localhost:8012). The dev targets deliberately
skip `npm ci`, which would wipe `node_modules` on every invocation.
