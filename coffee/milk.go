// The iced-latte milk path: open the fridge, vision-detect the milk bottle
// inside, pour it into the staged glass, put the bottle back where it was
// found, and shut the fridge. Gated by can_serve_iced_latte.
//
// Nothing here is new machinery — it is the three existing patterns composed:
// the cup/glass vision pickup (cup_pickup.go) with its own vision service,
// observe switch and grasp offsets; the pour pivot the espresso
// pour uses (iced.go); and the hinge-arc door sweep (door.go).
//
// The one thing neither the cup nor the glass needs is a way back. The bottle
// belongs in the fridge, and where in the fridge it stands changes every time
// somebody puts the milk away — so the return is not an authored pose but the
// grasp itself, replayed: pickup records the world centroid it grabbed at, and
// the return composes the same approach/grab offsets onto that centroid.
