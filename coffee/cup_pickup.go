// Vision-based cup pickup.
//
// pickCupDynamic is how setCupForCoffee acquires the empty cup. It sweeps the
// poses on the dedicated camera-observe switch
// (camera_observe_pose_switcher_name) one at a time, calling a vision service
// for cup detections at each. At every pose that sees at least one cup the
// detections are lifted into world frame, ranked by proximity to the gripper
// (closest first), and grabbed in turn — the configured approach/grab relative
// poses (from Config — they are offsets, not switch-resident world-frame poses)
// are composed onto each centroid and fed to moveToRawPose. The sweep stops as
// soon as a cup is in hand; when a pose's cups are all unreachable it continues
// to the remaining poses, so a cup reachable only from a later vantage is still
// found before we give up.
//
// Each detection's grasp Z is resolved from the surface it rests on rather than
// the noisy detected Z: with the container's configured height, the base is
// seated surfaceRestClearanceMm above the top of the static surface directly
// beneath it (see geom.SurfaceTopZUnder).
//
// When a full sweep grabs nothing, pickCupDynamic re-observes and retries,
// bounded by CupPickupMaxAttempts: if no pose saw a cup it asks the customer to
// place one; if cups were seen but none could be reached it asks the customer to
// nudge them, waiting noItemRetryDelay between attempts.
