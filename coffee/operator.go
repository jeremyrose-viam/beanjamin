// proceedQueue re-syncs the recorded world with the real one and, when a cancel
// or an order fault left the queue paused, releases the pause so processQueue
// starts the next order.
//
// The rebuild is unconditional: any idle state can hold mid-cycle mutations (a
// reparented filter frame, a held cup geometry, a staged glass) that no longer
// describe a machine an operator has since tidied up, and
// refreshFrameSystemIfClean declines to rebuild precisely because they are
// present. A faulted order pauses the queue for this, but a
// manually-stepped execute_action that fails leaves them behind with the queue
// running. The running gate is required because cachedFS may only be swapped
// while no sequence owns the arm.
//
// It clears the recorded fridge-door angle too: proceed is the operator saying
// the machine has been put right, fridge included. A rebuild cannot shut a real
// door, which is why no rebuild clears the angle on its own — the assertion is
// the operator's, so the response reports the angle forgotten and a door left
// standing is visible before the next plan routes through the panel. It also
// forgets the gripper's modeled contents without opening the gripper, so
// anything still in the jaws has to be taken out by hand first.
