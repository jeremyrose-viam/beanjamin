// Held-item geometry tracking.
//
// The cup or glass the gripper picks up is added to the cached frame system as a
// static "held-item" frame parented to the grip point (gripPoint), carrying the
// detection geometry expressed in the grip-point frame ("gripper-local"
// throughout this file). While it is
// present, every motion plan routes around the held item — so the arm doesn't
// drive the cup into the machine, the shelf, or itself while carrying it.
//
// The frame is attached rotated (heldItemFramePose) so its own +Z is the
// container's vertical axis rather than the gripper's tool axis. No collision
// geometry depends on that rotation, but the no-spill carry commands this frame
// by name, and its orientation bound only bounds the drink's tilt when measured
// about the container's own axis (see noSpillOrientationToleranceDegs in
// motion.go).
//
// The geometry is attached on grab (attachDetectedGeometry for a fresh vision
// detection, reattachGeometry when re-grabbing an item whose geometry was already
// cached this order) and removed on release (detachHeldGeometry). The grasp is
// assumed consistent across release/re-grab — the item is released and re-grabbed
// at the same pose — so the gripper-local geometry cached at pickup is reused
// verbatim on the re-grab. The staged glass is the exception: it is seated on
// the table when released (stageHeldGlass), and its re-grab is modeled from
// where it stands (regrabStagedGlass).
//
// This mirrors lockFilterFrame's frame-system mutation in motion.go, but the
// parent is the moving gripper rather than the world, and the geometry comes
// from vision rather than a part config.
