// Keep-alive: a periodic short hold of the machine's 1 CUP button. It runs water
// through the group head — Breville's documented purge — which resets the
// machine's own idle timer and keeps it at brew temperature. The machine sleeps
// after an hour idle and that hour is not configurable, so something physical has
// to touch it.
//
// The arm holds the portafilter throughout, so the purge poses are filter-frame
// poses on the filter switch and nothing is parked in the group head.
