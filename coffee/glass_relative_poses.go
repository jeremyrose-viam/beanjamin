// Pour poses anchored on the staged glass.
//
// The four pour poses (pour_approach/pour for the espresso cup,
// milk_pour_approach/milk_pour for the milk bottle) are not stored on the claws
// switch: they are configured as the pose of the held container (the held-item
// frame: on the grip point, +Z along the container's axis) relative to the
// center of the staged glass's rim, and the rim is read off the staged-glass
// obstacle in the frame system (its position and its height). The pours
// therefore follow wherever the glass was actually set down, and moving the
// staging area only means re-teaching staging.
