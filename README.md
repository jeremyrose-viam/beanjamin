# Beanjamin Module

The `viam:beanjamin` module provides these models for arm-based automation workflows:

1. **`viam:beanjamin:coffee`** - A generic service that orchestrates a full coffee brew cycle by sequentially moving through all poses on a pose switcher.
2. **`viam:beanjamin:multi-poses-execution-switch`** - A switch component that moves an arm between predefined poses using the Motion service.
3. **`viam:beanjamin:maintenance-sensor`** - A sensor component that reports whether the system is safe for maintenance (arm idle, no orders running or queued).
4. **`viam:beanjamin:order-sensor`** - A sensor that yields one reading per completed order (start/end timestamps and outcome) when wired from the coffee service.
5. **`viam:beanjamin:dial-control-motion`** - A generic service that translates Stream Deck dial inputs into relative arm motions.
6. **`viam:beanjamin:customer-detector`** - A generic service that identifies return customers via facial recognition using the [`viam:vision:face-identification`](https://github.com/viam-modules/viam-face-identification) vision service.
7. **`viam:beanjamin:crm`** - A generic service holding customer profiles keyed by email: a loyalty point per completed drink, and shared rewards customers pool those points toward.
8. **`viam:beanjamin:chore-wheel`** - A generic service that posts the weekly maintenance rota to Slack, rotating a roster of people through a list of chores.

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:multi-poses-execution-switch`

**API:** `rdk:component:switch`

Moves an arm (or any movable component) between a list of named poses via the Motion service. Each "position" of the switch corresponds to a pose. Only one movement can execute at a time.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "component_name": "<string>",
  "motion": "<string>",
  "reference_frame": "<string>",
  "poses": [
    {
      "pose_name": "<string>",
      "pose_value": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Name              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `component_name`  | string | Yes      | Name of the arm component to move.                                                      |
| `motion`          | string | Yes      | Name of the motion service (typically `"builtin"`).                                     |
| `reference_frame` | string | No       | Reference frame for poses. Defaults to `"world"`.                                       |
| `poses`           | array  | Yes      | One or more named poses. Pose names must be unique.                                     |

### Defining poses

Each pose in the `poses` array must have a `pose_name` and **exactly one** of two definition styles:

#### Absolute pose (`pose_value`)

Define the pose directly with position and orientation coordinates:

```json
{
  "pose_name": "home",
  "pose_value": {
    "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 500,
    "o_x": 0, "o_y": 0, "o_z": 1,
    "theta": 0
  }
}
```

**Pose value fields:** `x`, `y`, `z` are in millimeters. `o_x`, `o_y`, `o_z` define the orientation axis, `theta` is the rotation angle in degrees.

#### Relative pose (`baseline`)

Define a pose relative to another pose in the same `poses` array. Optionally add a `translation` (offset added to the baseline position) and/or an `orientation` (replaces the baseline orientation entirely). The baseline can appear anywhere in the array — before or after the pose that references it.

```json
{
  "pose_name": "left-of-home",
  "baseline": "home",
  "translation": { "x": -100 }
}
```

| Field         | Type   | Required            | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `baseline`    | string | Yes (instead of `pose_value`) | Name of another pose in the `poses` array.                                            |
| `translation` | object | No                  | Position offset added to the baseline. Fields: `x`, `y`, `z` (millimeters along world axes, default `0`), and `along_orientation` (millimeters along the baseline's normalized orientation vector, default `0`). |
| `orientation` | object | No                  | Orientation that **replaces** the baseline orientation. Fields: `o_x`, `o_y`, `o_z`, `theta`.    |

The `along_orientation` component is projected onto the **baseline's** orientation vector, not onto any `orientation` override set on the same pose — translation is applied before the orientation replace. If the baseline's orientation vector has zero norm, the `along_orientation` offset is silently skipped.

Baselines can be chained — a relative pose can itself be used as a baseline for another pose. Multiple poses can share the same baseline.

**Validation rules:**
- A pose must have either `pose_value` or `baseline`, not both.
- `translation` and `orientation` are only allowed with `baseline`.
- The `baseline` must reference an existing `pose_name` in the `poses` array.
- Circular baseline references are not allowed (e.g. A → B → A).

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "component_name": "my-arm",
  "motion": "builtin",
  "reference_frame": "world",
  "poses": [
    {
      "pose_name": "home",
      "pose_value": {
        "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 500,
        "o_x": 0, "o_y": 0, "o_z": 1,
        "theta": 0
      }
    },
    {
      "pose_name": "above-home",
      "baseline": "home",
      "translation": { "z": 100 }
    },
    {
      "pose_name": "backed-off-home",
      "baseline": "home",
      "translation": { "along_orientation": -50 }
    },
    {
      "pose_name": "pour",
      "baseline": "home",
      "translation": { "x": 200, "y": 100, "z": -150 },
      "orientation": { "o_x": 0, "o_y": 1, "o_z": 0, "theta": 90 }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- **home** is defined absolutely at `(0, 0, 500)` with orientation `(0, 0, 1, 0°)`.
- **above-home** inherits home's position and orientation, then adds `z: +100` → final position `(0, 0, 600)`.
- **backed-off-home** inherits home's pose and translates `-50` mm along home's orientation vector `(0, 0, 1)` → final position `(0, 0, 450)`.
- **pour** inherits home's position, adds a translation → `(200, 100, 350)`, and overrides the orientation to `(0, 1, 0, 90°)`.

### Switch Interface

| Method                 | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `GetNumberOfPositions` | Returns the total number of poses and their names. |
| `GetPosition`          | Returns the index of the current pose (0-based).   |
| `SetPosition(index)`   | Moves the arm to the pose at the given index.      |

### DoCommand

**`set_position_by_name`** - Move to a pose by name.

```json
{ "set_position_by_name": "home" }
```

**`get_current_position_name`** - Get the name of the current pose.

```json
{ "get_current_position_name": true }
```

Returns:

```json
{ "position_name": "home" }
```

**`get_pose_by_name`** - Get the pose coordinates, reference frame, and component name for a named pose.

```json
{ "get_pose_by_name": "home" }
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 500,
  "o_x": 0, "o_y": 0, "o_z": 1,
  "theta": 0,
  "reference_frame": "world",
  "component_name": "my-arm"
}
```

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:coffee`

**API:** `rdk:service:generic`

Orchestrates a full coffee brew cycle using a `multi-poses-execution-switch` component. Supports preparing espresso and lungo orders, executing individual actions, and stopping a run (`cancel`). Recovering afterwards is done by hand, then `proceed`.

`has_separate_brew_buttons` selects which coffee machine the arm is driving, and with it which claw poses the switcher must carry:

| | `false` (default) | `true` |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | one toggle switch | one momentary button per shot size |
| Claw poses required | `coffee_button_approach`, `coffee_button_on`, `coffee_button_off` | `espresso_button_approach` / `_press`, `lungo_button_approach` / `_press` |
| Who sets the dose | the hold duration — `brew_time_sec` / `lungo_brew_time_sec` | the machine; the brew times only wait the pour out |
| Extra actions | `turn_coffee_button_on`, `turn_coffee_button_off` | `press_espresso_button`, `press_lungo_button`, `brew_lungo` |

Only the selected machine's poses are validated at startup, and only its actions are registered for `execute_action`. Under `true`, both shot sizes are required even if only one is on the menu — the drink is known per-order, so a switcher that cannot reach the lungo button is misconfigured regardless of what is queued.

When `keepalive` is configured, the **filter** pose switcher must additionally carry `purge_approach` and `purge_press`. These are filter-frame poses, not claw-frame ones: the arm keeps the portafilter in its claws and presses the machine's 1 CUP button with the assembly in hand, so nothing is parked in the group head and no filter basket gets wet. Author `purge_press` so the press is a straight-in linear move from `purge_approach`. See "Keeping the machine at brew temperature" below.

```

Add a **`viam:beanjamin:order-sensor`** component to the machine, put it in the coffee service **depends_on**, and set `order_sensor_name` to that component’s name. When an order attempt finishes, one reading is queued with `start_time`, `end_time`, `order_ok`, `duration_ms`, and — for observability — `failed_step`, `operator_cancelled`, `trace_id`, the `decaf` path flag, and `error_message` (if applicable).

**Usage sensor.** The optional `usage_sensor_name` field points at a single sensor resource that holds several counters, one per key, updated through the brew lifecycle. Setting the field automatically registers the sensor as a dependency of the coffee service, so no manual `depends_on` entry is required. The sensor must support both the `Readings` API and a `DoCommand({"set": {<key>: <value>}})` that overwrites the named counter (and preserves the others). The coffee service updates each counter with a best-effort read-modify-write: it reads the current value via `Readings`, computes the new value, and writes it back via `DoCommand`. The keys are:

- `regular_grinds` — +1 after each regular (non-decaf) grind
- `decaf_grinds` — +1 after each decaf grind
- `usage` — +1 after a regular brew (espresso/decaf), +1.5 after a lungo brew (lungo/decaf_lungo, and the iced drinks, which pour a lungo)
- `cleanings` — +1 after each cleaning cycle
- `ice_dispenses` — +1 after each ice dispense (iced coffee only)
- `ice_dispense_timeouts` — +1 when a watched ice dispense hits either ceiling — `ice_dispense_max_sec` from the pin opening, or `ice_after_first_seen_max_sec` from the first sighting — without the surface passing the stop row (`ice_vision_enabled` only). The glass is served as it is, so a climbing counter is how an empty hopper — or a stop row that no longer matches how the glass is being gripped — shows up. The log line names which ceiling fired, and the saved frame is tagged `ice_timeout` or `ice_surface_cap`.
- `ice_shadow_disagreements` — +1 per watched dispense where the brightness shadow and the contrast step differed in kind rather than in timing: the shadow never saw ice, saw it but never reached the stop row, or reached the stop row on the first surface it ever saw. The last means it locked onto something already there — the rim or a reflection — and is the one that would rule out ever promoting it. Timing gaps are expected and are not counted. See "Brightness shadow" below.
- `milk_pours` — +1 after each milk pour (iced latte only)
- `drip_tray_brews` — +1 after each brew
- `espresso_cups_used` — +1 after the brew cup is placed, on every drink
- `latte_glasses_used` — +1 after a latte glass is fetched, on iced drinks only (`iced_coffee`/`iced_latte`)
- `successful_consecutive_orders` — +1 after each successful order, reset to 0 after any failed **or** operator-cancelled order

Consumable counters increment only after their step completes successfully, so a brew that fails partway leaves the consumables it actually used counted and does not roll them back. A missing counter key is treated as 0 (so the first update lands a fresh count). All updates are best-effort: a read/write failure logs a warning and never fails the brew. When `usage_sensor_name` is unset, every update is skipped.

Configure a [`viam:video:storage`](https://github.com/viam-modules/video-store) camera on the machine. After each order attempt, the coffee service saves a clip via a `save` DoCommand issued from a background goroutine, so it never blocks the queue. Each clip includes a fixed **N seconds** of pre-roll (ring-buffer permitting) and **N seconds** of post-roll. The save is **synchronous** (`async: false`) so slice failures surface in the logs instead of being dropped silently; because a synchronous slice can only read segment files that have already closed on disk, the goroutine waits roughly one video-store segment (~30s) past the clip's end before issuing the save.

The save request includes a `tags` entry with the order UUID — this is what links clips to orders for cloud data filtering — and a minimal JSON `metadata` blob containing only `order_id` and `order_status` (`ok` or `failed`), which the video-store appends to the clip filename. Clips are saved after every attempt, including failed brews or panics. Failure detail (the error and the step it failed at) is not stored in the clip metadata; it is recorded separately on the order sensor.

**Slack notifications.** The optional `slack_notifier_name` field points at a [`viam:notifications:slack`](https://github.com/viam-modules/notifications) generic service. Setting the field automatically registers it as a dependency of the coffee service, so no manual `depends_on` entry is required. When set, the coffee service sends a best-effort Slack message on every **non-successful** order attempt — both genuine faults and operator cancels — via `DoCommand({"command": "send", "blocks": [...], "text": ...})`. The message is laid out with [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) and mirrors the per-attempt fields the order sensor records, so it's a self-contained record: a header that distinguishes a fault (`:x: Order failed`) from an operator cancel (`:warning: Order cancelled by operator`), a fields section with the drink, customer, the step it failed (or was cancelled) at, the duration, and the `decaf` flag, the error in a code block (faults only), and a context footer with the order ID, trace ID, start time, and — when the module is cloud-connected — clickable `app.viam.com` deep-links to this machine's logs (built from the `VIAM_MACHINE_ID` / `VIAM_PRIMARY_ORG_ID` environment variables Viam injects) and, when `cam_storage_mux_name` is configured, to the order's video clip (a data page filtered by the order-ID tag, scoped to `VIAM_LOCATION_ID`). All links are omitted on a local or test machine where those environment variables are unset. Because the clip uploads asynchronously *after* the notification is sent, the clip link may show no results for the first ~15–60s. The flat `text` value is sent alongside as the notification/accessibility fallback Slack uses when blocks can't render. Sends run off the queue goroutine (so a slow Slack call never stalls the next order) and are bounded by a 10-second timeout; a send failure logs a warning and never affects brewing. The Slack channel/credentials (bot token or webhook URL) are configured on the notifier service itself. When `slack_notifier_name` is unset, no notifications are sent.

**Top-level fields:**

| Name                       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pose_switcher_name`       | string | Yes      | Name of the multi-poses-execution-switch component.                                                           |
| `claws_pose_switcher_name` | string | Yes      | Name of the claws pose switcher component.                                                                    |
| `arm_name`                 | string | Yes      | Name of the arm component used for motion planning and execution.                                             |
| `gripper_name`             | string | Yes      | Name of the gripper component.                                                                                |
| `speech_service_name`      | string | No       | Name of a text-to-speech generic service for spoken greetings.                                                |
| `has_separate_brew_buttons` | bool  | No       | `true` when the machine has one momentary button per shot size (poked, then released); `false` (default) for a single toggle switch the claw holds down for the whole brew. Changes which claw poses are required and which actions exist — see the table above. |
| `brew_time_sec`            | float  | No       | Espresso brew duration in seconds (default: 8). Under a toggle this is the hold time and therefore the dose; with `has_separate_brew_buttons` the machine controls the dose and this must be at least as long as its actual pour, or the arm reaches for the cup mid-stream. |
| `lungo_brew_time_sec`      | float  | No       | Same, for a lungo — also used by `iced_coffee` and `iced_latte`, which pour a lungo (default: 15). |
| `button_press_hold_sec`    | float  | No       | How long the claw dwells on a brew button so the momentary switch registers, in seconds (must be >= 0; unset means no dwell). Raise if presses are intermittent. Ignored unless `has_separate_brew_buttons` is set. |
| `grind_time_sec`           | float  | No       | Bean grinding duration in seconds, applied to both regular and decaf grinders (default: 7.5).                 |
| `gripper_hold_min_pos`     | float  | No       | Gripper jaw position (0–850) below which the gripper is considered closed/empty. Positions in `[min, max]` mean an object (cup or glass) is held; used to verify grabs and self-heal an open gripper at brew-cycle start (default: 430).                 |
| `gripper_hold_max_pos`     | float  | No       | Gripper jaw position (0–850) above which the gripper is considered open (default: 685).                       |
| `gripper_open_timeout_sec` | float  | No       | How long the portafilter handoff waits for the jaws to actually read open before giving up (default: 3). `release_filter` and `grab_filter` both open the jaws and then travel along the filter handle at claw clearance, so moving while the jaws are still closing drags the filter against the bayonet on the way out or strikes the handle on the way in. Rather than sleeping a fixed interval, both poll the real jaw position every 500ms until it clears `gripper_hold_max_pos` and fail with a "gripper did not open" error at this timeout. Raise it on a build whose jaws travel slowly — clamp force and jaw range both lengthen the open stroke. |
| `slow_movement_vel_degs_per_sec` | float | No    | Max joint velocity (degrees/sec) for the **slow tier**: a step with a `LinearConstraint`, a pivot or circular motion, and the spill/scatter-prone carries — the no-spill cup/glass carry, the milk bottle, and loose grounds on the way to the tamper. Everything else (an ordinary empty traverse, the tamped puck) runs at the arm's own default speed. Raise carefully — precision, contact, and the spill-free carries all rely on this (default: 25). |
| `slow_movement_acc_degs_per_sec2` | float | No | Max joint acceleration (degrees/sec²) for the slow tier. Gentle acceleration matters more than top speed for both precision and sloshing, so this defaults to a value below the arm's own (default: 25). Lower it further to ease into and out of contact and carries. |
| `portafilter_shake_sec`    | float  | No       | Duration in seconds of each circular shake during `unlock_portafilter`, to dislodge a stuck puck. The arm shakes twice, once at `coffee_shake` and once at `coffee_shake_left`, returning to `coffee_in` in between so both shakes run the same move out of the group head. A puck stuck on either side of the basket then gets worked from both. When set, requires both poses in the filter pose switcher; author them to lean opposite ways and keep the tilted filter clear of the group head. Defaults to 0, which skips the shakes and the travel to those poses: the arm withdraws straight from `coffee_in` to `coffee_approach`. |
| `lock_overshoot_degs`      | float  | No       | Extra rotation applied to the `coffee_locked_final` lock pivot, unwound back onto the authored angle within the same planned trajectory. The claws slip on the portafilter handle once the bayonet is under load, so the arm has to over-rotate for the filter to seat; the unwind re-zeroes the grip, since a seated filter out-holds the claws and the handle slides back through them. Defaults to 0 (no overshoot) — tune it on the machine. |
| `save_motion_requests_dir` | string | No       | Directory to save debugging payloads. Each plan writes a single request+response JSON (RDK's `WriteRequestAndResponseToFile`; readable back with `ReadRequestAndResponseFromFile`, and the response is absent when planning failed), nested under `tag=<order-id>/tag=step_<step>/tag=motion_<move\|pivot\|circular\|carry>/tag=planning_<success\|failure>/`. When this directory is a Viam data-synced capture dir, the data manager reads those `tag=` segments and tags each uploaded file, so plans are searchable on the data page by order, step, motion type, and planning outcome — and a failed order's Slack notification deep-links to that order's plan requests (which the reader can narrow to `planning_failure` or a specific step). Also writes a `visualization_snapshot_<timestamp>_<cup\|glass>.pb.gz` snapshot on each cup/glass observation: the whole frame system resolved at the joint configuration the arm held when the photo was taken, plus every detection's point cloud (as captured, anchored at the camera's world pose) and the world-frame bounding box the grasp was derived from. Drag the file onto a [visualization](https://github.com/viamrobotics/visualization) viewer to replay the observation — the `visualization_snapshot` prefix is what its drag-and-drop loader keys off. |
| `order_sensor_name`        | string | No       | Name of a `viam:beanjamin:order-sensor` sensor to notify when each order attempt completes (must appear in **depends_on**). |
| `usage_sensor_name`        | string | No       | Name of a single sensor whose per-key counters are updated through the brew lifecycle: `regular_grinds`, `decaf_grinds`, `usage`, `cleanings`, `ice_dispenses`, `ice_dispense_timeouts`, `ice_shadow_disagreements`, `drip_tray_brews`, `espresso_cups_used`, `latte_glasses_used`, and `successful_consecutive_orders`. See "Usage sensor" below. |
| `cam_storage_mux_name` | string | No   | Name of a [`viam:multiplexer:resource-multiplexer`](https://github.com/viam-modules/multiplexer) generic service whose dependencies are `viam:video:storage` stores; when set, saves a clip per order attempt (synchronous `save`) to all configured stores. |
| `data_dir`                 | string | No       | Directory for persistent module data. When set alongside `cam_storage_mux_name`, a pending-clip record is written under `<data_dir>/pending-clips` when each order starts and removed only once that order's clip has been saved successfully — a save that fails (or never runs because the process died first) leaves the record in place. Use with a Viam scheduled job calling `cleanup_pending_clips` to recover clips for any order whose save was interrupted or failed. |
| `slack_notifier_name`      | string | No       | Name of a [`viam:notifications:slack`](https://github.com/viam-modules/notifications) generic service. When set, the coffee service sends a best-effort Slack message on every non-successful order attempt (faults and operator cancels). See "Slack notifications" above. |
| `customer_detector_name`   | string | No       | Name of a `viam:beanjamin:customer-detector` service. When set, the coffee service credits each **successfully** completed order (when the `prepare_order` carried a `customer_email`) to that customer's order history via the detector's `record_order` DoCommand, powering "the usual". Setting the field automatically registers it as a dependency. Unset disables order-history recording. |
| `crm_name`                 | string | No       | Name of a `viam:beanjamin:crm` service. When set, each **successfully** completed order that carried a `customer_email` earns that email one loyalty point through the CRM's `credit_points` DoCommand (keyed by order ID, so a drink is never credited twice). Registered as an optional dependency: a CRM that is down costs the points (logged with the email and order ID, for a backfill), never the drink. Unset disables loyalty points. |
| `delivery_handler_name`    | string | No       | Name of a generic service on a peer delivery machine, reached through a remote part (e.g. `"delivery-bot:mission-control"` after adding the peer machine as a remote named `delivery-bot` in app.viam.com). Setting the field automatically registers it as an (optional) dependency. When a `fulfillment: "delivery"` order's drink lands in the serving area, the coffee service sends that service a `delivery_request` DoCommand (see `send_delivery_message` below for the payload and the manual test hook). Unset disables outbound peer messaging; delivery orders then just announce and rely on pickup from the serving area. |
| `input_range_override`     | object | No       | Narrows joint limits on named frames before motion planning. Outer key is the frame name (typically the arm); inner key is either the joint name or its stringified index (e.g. `"5"` for the last joint of a 6-DoF arm). Each value is `{ "min_degs": number, "max_degs": number }`. |
| `conversational`           | bool   | No       | When true, the coffee service speaks its own greetings, almost-ready prompts, order-received lines, and rejection quips through `speech_service_name`. When false (default), the service stays silent except for the drink-ready announcement at cup handoff — leaving the rest of the talking to an external orchestrator (e.g. `viam:conversation-bundle:voice-command`). |
| `cup_vision_service_name`             | string | Yes      | Name of a `rdk:service:vision` segmenter that returns cup detections via `GetObjectPointClouds`. Cup pickup is always vision-guided — the arm detects the empty cup rather than grabbing from a fixed pose. |
| `src_camera_name`                     | string | Yes      | Source camera the vision service segments from. Must be present in the frame system. |
| `camera_observe_pose_switcher_name`   | string | Yes      | Switcher holding the camera observation vantages. Poses are swept **one at a time** and vision run at each (within-pose near-duplicates within 40 mm collapsed); at each pose that sees a cup the arm tries to grab the candidates closest-first, and the sweep stops as soon as a cup is in hand. When a pose's cups are all unreachable the sweep **continues to the remaining poses**, so a cup reachable only from a later vantage is still found before the machine gives up. Must include a pose named `cup_observe` (the home/recovery pose), and all poses must move the `cam` frame (set the switch's `component_name` to `cam`) |
| `cup_approach_relative_pose`          | object | Yes      | 6-DoF offset composed onto the detected cup centroid for the pre-grab pose. Shape `{ "x", "y", "z", "o_x", "o_y", "o_z", "theta" }`; same gripper orientation as the grab pose but translated further back from the cup. **Not** stored on the pose switch — it's an offset, not a real world-frame pose. |
| `cup_grab_relative_pose`              | object | Yes      | 6-DoF offset composed onto the detected cup centroid for the final grab pose. Same shape as `cup_approach_relative_pose`; gripper orientation for a side-grab with a small translation onto the cup. |
| `cup_pickup_max_attempts`             | int    | No       | Cap on full observe-and-grab attempts per order. Each attempt sweeps **every** observe pose, grabbing the first reachable cup across all of them (closest-first within each pose, continuing to later poses when a pose's cups are all unreachable). When a whole sweep grabs nothing the machine re-observes and retries — asking the customer to place a cup (none seen anywhere) or to nudge the cups (some seen but none reachable) between attempts. Default 3. |
| `cup_dimensions`                      | object | Yes      | Known cup size. Shape `{ "diameter_mm", "height_mm" }` (both must be > 0). The held-item bounding box is built with width = depth = `diameter_mm` and height = `height_mm` (a square-footprint box approximating the round cup), centered on the **grasp centroid** (the point the gripper is sent to). Required because every carried container is tracked as a held item (see **Held-item geometry** below), and modeling a known size around the grasp point avoids a box skewed by a partially-observed point cloud. The known `height_mm` also drives **resting-surface seating** (below): the grasp Z is derived from the surface the cup stands on instead of the noisy detected Z. |
| `max_batch_size`           | int    | No       | Cap on `prepare_order.count` — how many identical drinks one DoCommand may enqueue at once. Defaults to 10 when unset. Protects the queue against runaway voice commands or LLM hallucinations. |
| `door_open_angle_degs`     | float  | No       | Swing angle for the `open_door` command, in degrees. Defaults to 90. |
| `door_pivot_degrees_per_step` | float | No     | Per-step θ increment for the `open_door` sweep, in degrees. Smaller values re-plan the door pose more finely (smoother tracking, more planning calls). Defaults to 10. |
| `door_grasp_frame_name`    | string | No       | Frame the gripper aims at for `open_door` — its center is the grasp target, and it's the frame tracked through the sweep and allowed to contact the gripper. Must be a child frame within the `fridge-door` subtree so it rides the swing. Defaults to `fridge-handle-ball`. |
| `door_approach_relative_pose` | object | For `open_door` | A `RelativePose` (`x`,`y`,`z`,`o_x`,`o_y`,`o_z`,`theta`) offset composed onto the grasp frame's center (world axes) to produce the pre-grasp standoff — the door analog of `cup_approach_relative_pose`, but resolved against the live grasp frame instead of a detected cup. Its orientation is the base grasp orientation, which `door_grasp_yaw_ratio` then yaws through the swing. Required to run `open_door`. |
| `door_grasp_yaw_ratio`     | float  | No       | How far the gripper yaws about world Z as the door swings: the grasp orientation (and the approach/retract standoff) is turned by `ratio x theta` — a pure function of the door angle, so `open_door` and `close_door` are exact inverses and `door_approach_relative_pose` is authored for the **shut** door. `-1` (default) counter-rotates, keeping the wrist on the near side of the ball as the handle swings away; `0` holds the orientation fixed in world; `1` keeps the tool square to the panel. The sign is a reachability choice — the handle is a sphere, so the grasp does not constrain wrist roll. Replanning a failed 75° sweep offline put `1` out of IK solutions by θ=47° and `0` out by θ=75°. `0` and negatives are honored, so unset is distinct from zero. |
| `keepalive`                | object | No       | Enables the keep-alive purge loop, which holds the machine's 1 CUP button periodically so the machine never falls out of brew temperature. Requires `has_separate_brew_buttons`. Omit to disable. Fields: `auto_start` and `end` (`"HH:MM"` local, the half-open window `[auto_start, end)`; `auto_start` must mirror the time programmed into the machine's own Auto Start setting), `timezone` (IANA name, required — an empty value is rejected rather than silently meaning UTC), `days` (lowercase three-letter names, default Mon–Fri), `after_min` (idle minutes before a purge is due, default 40), `check_interval_min` (tick period, default 5), `hold_sec` (button dwell, default 1 — this sets how much water reaches the drip tray). `after_min + 2*check_interval_min` must be under 55, since the machine sleeps after roughly 60 idle minutes. See "Keeping the machine at brew temperature" below. |
| `can_serve_decaf`          | bool   | No       | Enables the `decaf` and `decaf_lungo` drinks, which grind from the decaf grinder instead of the regular one. Orders for those drinks are rejected when this is `false`. Default `false`. |
| `can_serve_iced`           | bool   | No       | Enables the `iced_coffee` drink. When `true`, the machine brews a lungo (`lungo_brew_time_sec`, and the lungo button under `has_separate_brew_buttons`); after brewing, the arm vision-detects a glass off the top shelf, dispenses ice into it via `ice_board_name`/`ice_pin_name`, sets the glass in a staging area, then pours the espresso over the ice. Both finished items — the empty espresso cup and the iced glass — are then placed in the serving area at the next round-robin slots (two slots are consumed per order). The glass is always vision-detected, so iced coffee requires `ice_board_name`, `ice_pin_name`, the `glass_*` vision fields below, and the iced claws poses below. A `serving-area` (or `serving-area_origin`) Box geometry must exist in the framesystem; this is checked at runtime, not at config time. Default `false`. |
| `ice_board_name`           | string | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | Name of a `rdk:component:board` whose GPIO pin triggers the ice machine. |
| `ice_pin_name`             | string | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | Board pin held HIGH to dispense ice. Required — there is no default pin. |
| `ice_dispense_sec`         | float  | No       | How long the ice pin is held HIGH per drink, in seconds. Defaults to 5. With `ice_vision_enabled` this is only the fallback used when the camera fails. |
| `ice_vision_enabled`       | bool   | No       | Watch the glass while ice falls and close the pin when the ice surface passes `ice_stop_row_px`, instead of dispensing for a fixed `ice_dispense_sec`. Default `false`: the shipping stop row was measured on one machine at one glass seating, so confirm yours with `check_ice_level` before turning this on. |
| `ice_stop_row_px`          | int    | No       | Image row the ice surface must reach for the glass to count as full. The camera rides the gripper, so a row is a fixed height above the jaws. Defaults to 595. |
| `ice_contrast_window`      | int    | No       | Rows averaged on each side of a candidate row when measuring the brightness step. The ice surface is a gradual edge, so a narrow window measures only part of it. Defaults to 48. |
| `ice_min_contrast`         | float  | No       | Smallest brightness step counted as an ice surface. Below it the frame reports no ice. Defaults to 25. |
| `ice_roi_x0`, `ice_roi_x1` | int    | No       | Left and right edges of the column strip whose row brightness is averaged, inset from the glass walls. Default 700 and 910. |
| `ice_roi_y1`               | int    | No       | Bottom of the scan — the lowest part of the glass the camera can see before the ice machine's ledge occludes it. Defaults to 670. There is no `ice_roi_y0`: the top of the scan is derived as `ice_stop_row_px - ice_contrast_window`, which is what keeps the glass rim out of the measurement. |
| `ice_dispense_max_sec`     | float  | No       | Absolute ceiling on a watched dispense, measured from the pin opening. On reaching it the glass is served as it is and `ice_dispense_timeouts` is bumped; the order is not failed. Defaults to 60 — an observed fill took 17-20s, so a much lower value times out every drink. This is the backstop for a hopper that never delivers; `ice_after_first_seen_max_sec` is the one that bounds overflow. |
| `ice_after_first_seen_max_sec` | float | No  | Second ceiling, measured from the first confirmed sighting rather than from the pin opening. Defaults to 30. It exists because `ice_dispense_max_sec` has to clear a whole fill, which leaves it ~10s above a full glass on a run whose surface is never confirmed past the stop row — and that overflow is ice, not a light drink. Ends the dispense the same way the absolute ceiling does. Must be more than `ice_check_interval_sec`, or the dispense ends on the first poll after ice appears. |
| `ice_dispense_min_sec`     | float  | No       | How long the pin is held open before any reading counts. Defaults to 2. |
| `ice_check_interval_sec`   | float  | No       | How often the glass is measured during a watched dispense. Defaults to 0.5. |
| `ice_brightness_thresh`    | float  | No       | Row-brightness cutoff (0-255) for the **brightness shadow**: a second read of every dispense frame by absolute brightness, logged beside the contrast step and never acted on. Unset (the default) the shadow is off, and it deliberately has no default value — an absolute cutoff is the one number that does not survive a change in lighting, so read it off the machine with `check_ice_level`, which prints the range of row brightness it sees. See "Brightness shadow" below. |
| `ice_bright_run`           | int    | No       | Consecutive rows that must clear `ice_brightness_thresh` for the shadow to call it a surface. One bright row is a glint off the glass; ice holds its brightness over many rows. Defaults to 8. |
| `pour_vel_degs_per_sec`    | float  | No       | Max joint velocity (degrees/sec) for the pour tilt pivot — the espresso pour and the milk pour alike. The return-upright pivot runs at the slow-movement speed instead, so the container's remaining liquid doesn't slosh out. Overrides the general slow-movement velocity so the pour isn't dragged out (default: 60). Lower it if the espresso splashes over the ice. |
| `pour_acc_degs_per_sec2`   | float  | No       | Max joint acceleration (degrees/sec²) for the pour tilt pivot. The tilt is a short move that's usually acceleration-limited, so this — not velocity — is what actually snaps it faster. Default `0` leaves the arm's own acceleration in place; raise it to speed the tilt, watching for splash and joint stress. |
| `glass_vision_service_name`           | string | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | Name of a `rdk:service:vision` segmenter that returns glass detections via `GetObjectPointClouds`. Glass pickup mirrors cup pickup but with its own vision service and observe poses (tuned for the taller iced-coffee glass); it shares the cup camera (`src_camera_name`). |
| `glass_observe_pose_switcher_name`    | string | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | Switcher holding the glass observation vantages (swept one at a time, same as the cup observe switch). Must include a pose named `glass_observe` (home/recovery), and all poses must move the `cam` frame. |
| `glass_approach_relative_pose`        | object | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | 6-DoF gripper offset composed onto the detected glass centroid for the pre-grab pose (same shape as `cup_approach_relative_pose`), tuned for the taller glass. |
| `glass_grab_relative_pose`            | object | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | 6-DoF gripper offset for the final glass grab pose. |
| `glass_dimensions`                    | object | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | Known glass size. Same shape and behavior as `cup_dimensions` (`{ "diameter_mm", "height_mm" }`, both > 0), applied to the glass held-item geometry; its `height_mm` likewise drives resting-surface seating (below). Only the iced flow picks up a glass, so it is required — and only checked — when `can_serve_iced` is set. |
| `pour_approach_relative_pose` / `pour_relative_pose` | object | When `can_serve_iced` is enabled | The pose of the held espresso cup upright above the staged glass, and tilted to pour, relative to the **center of the staged glass's rim**. Same shape as `cup_approach_relative_pose`, but it describes the **held container** (the `held-item` frame), not the gripper: `x`/`y`/`z` in mm along world axes places the grip point, and `o_x`/`o_y`/`o_z`/`theta` is the container's absolute world orientation — upright is `o_z: 1`, and e.g. `o_x: 1, o_z: 1` tilts it 45° toward +X. They may differ in `x`/`y`/`z` as well as orientation: the tilt moves the container along the straight line between the two points while it rotates, in lockstep — e.g. set `z` higher on the pour pose to lift the container as it tips (and lower it as it rights on the way back). Identical `x`/`y`/`z` gives a tilt in place. See **Staged-glass-relative pours** below. |
| `milk_pour_approach_relative_pose` / `milk_pour_relative_pose` | object | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | Same as the espresso pair, for the milk bottle. The bottle is taller and heavier than the espresso cup, so it has its own pair; the tilt only has to clear the rim — how much milk lands is `milk_pour_sec`. |
| `can_serve_iced_latte`                | bool   | No       | Enables the `iced_latte` drink: the whole iced-coffee sequence, plus a fridge trip for milk once the iced glass is staged, before the espresso is poured over it. The arm opens the fridge door, vision-detects the milk bottle inside, pours it into the staged glass, sets the bottle back down where it found it, and shuts the door. Requires `can_serve_iced` (the latte is served in the iced glass, over ice), `door_approach_relative_pose` (the milk is behind the fridge door), the `milk_*` fields below and the iced-latte claws poses below. Default `false`. |
| `milk_vision_service_name`            | string | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | Name of a `rdk:service:vision` segmenter that returns milk-bottle detections via `GetObjectPointClouds`. Milk pickup mirrors cup and glass pickup with its own vision service and observe poses; it shares the cup camera (`src_camera_name`). |
| `milk_observe_pose_switcher_name`     | string | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | Switcher holding the milk observation vantages, looking into the **open** fridge. Must include a pose named `milk_observe` (home/recovery), and all poses must move the `cam` frame. Same sweep semantics as the cup observe switch. |
| `milk_approach_relative_pose`         | object | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | 6-DoF gripper offset composed onto the detected bottle centroid for the pre-grab standoff (same shape as `cup_approach_relative_pose`). It is also what the **return** aims at, so it must be a clean straight-up standoff over the bottle's spot on the shelf. |
| `milk_grab_relative_pose`             | object | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | 6-DoF gripper offset for the final bottle grab pose — and, replayed onto the recorded pickup centroid, the pose the bottle is set back down at. |
| `milk_bottle_dimensions`              | object | When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled | Known bottle size. Same shape and behavior as `cup_dimensions` (`{ "diameter_mm", "height_mm" }`, both > 0), applied to the held-bottle geometry; its `height_mm` likewise drives resting-surface seating (below). Required — and only checked — when `can_serve_iced_latte` is set. |
| `milk_options`                        | list of objects | No | The milks in the fridge, each `{"name", "spot"}`, e.g. `[{"name": "whole", "spot": "left"}, {"name": "oat", "spot": "right"}]`, for fetching the milk from taught poses instead of vision. **Not used to move the arm yet** — the milk is still found by vision — but when set it is validated and each spot's poses must exist on the claws switch (see the iced-latte claws poses below). `spot` names where the bottle stands; its poses are named after it, `milk_<spot>_approach` and `milk_<spot>_grab`, so renaming a milk or moving it is a config change, with no poses to re-teach. Names and spots are lowercase letters, digits and underscores; none may repeat, and the spot `pour` is reserved. |
| `milk_pour_sec`                       | float  | No       | How long the tilted bottle is held over the glass, in seconds. This — not the tilt angle — is the milk dose, so tune it on the machine against the bottle and glass in use. Defaults to 4. |
| `serving_approach_relative_pose`      | object | Yes      | 6-DoF gripper offset composed onto the serving-area slot anchor for the pre-release approach pose (same shape as `cup_approach_relative_pose`). Used for both the hot cup and the iced glass. |
| `serving_grab_relative_pose`          | object | Yes      | 6-DoF gripper offset composed onto the serving-area slot anchor for the release pose. Same shape as `serving_approach_relative_pose`; shared by cup and glass placement. |
| `fake_mode`                           | bool   | No       | Test-machine knob. When `true`, `AllowedCollision` entries that reference gripper sub-geometries (e.g. `gripper:claws`, which only exist on the real ufactory gripper) are skipped, so motion plans validate against fake hardware. Leave unset on the real bot. Default `false`. |

Glass and milk-bottle pickup reuse `cup_pickup_max_attempts` (an item-agnostic operational knob); there are no glass- or milk-specific versions.

**No-spill carry.** Every **free traverse of a filled container** is planned with a **15° orientation constraint** (`noSpillOrientationToleranceDegs` in `coffee/motion.go`) instead of free-planning straight to the goal. RDK checks the constraint along the whole path as a tube of that width around the **direct slerp** from the carry's start orientation to its goal, so one start-to-goal segment holds the container near level for the entire traverse — no intermediate waypoints are needed. Both endpoints are upright container poses, so the slerp itself stays level and 15° leaves the drink well inside a full cup's static spill angle. The constraint **ignores theta** (spin about the container's own vertical axis): a container spills when tipped, not when spun, so only tilt is bounded. The path itself is unconstrained: the planner is free to route around the machine however it likes, subject only to collision avoidance and the orientation tube. This covers the serving-area placement of a **filled** container (the hot cup and the iced glass), carrying the ice-filled glass to the staging area, carrying the espresso cup to the pour position, and both carries of the open milk bottle (fridge to the pour position, and back to the fridge). The espresso cup's own trip to the shelf happens *after* it has been poured over the ice, so it is empty by then and free-plans straight to the slot — there is nothing left in it to slosh. Manual `place_held` assumes filled. The goal commands the **held-item (container) frame** rather than the gripper — the goal pose is converted onto it — because the orientation bound is measured in the commanded frame's own axes, and the held-item frame's **+Z is the container's vertical axis** (see **Held-item geometry** below). Tune the tolerance on hardware.

**Held-item geometry.** A picked-up cup/glass/milk bottle is always tracked: its geometry — a box of the configured `cup_dimensions` / `glass_dimensions` / `milk_bottle_dimensions` centered on the grasp centroid — is attached under the `grip-point` frame in the cached frame system as a `held-item` frame, so motion planning routes around the held item until it is set down (and is restored on each re-grab — the brewed cup from under the machine, the staged glass). The frame sits **on the grip point** (its parent) and is **rotated onto the container's axes**: its +Z is the container's vertical axis, world-upright at the moment of the grab and tilting with the container thereafter as the wrist moves — that is the frame the no-spill carry commands and measures tilt against, and the frame the pour poses describe. Its pose does not move the geometry (a frame's geometry attaches at the frame's *parent*, not the frame itself), so collision behavior is unchanged by it. `addHeldItemFrame` fails if the frame system has no `grip-point` frame. When the brewed cup is re-grabbed but nothing was cached to restore — e.g. a manually-stepped serving that never ran the vision cup pickup — its held-item box is modeled from `cup_dimensions` and the grip point's current world pose, so the pour and shelf placement still track the cup. The gripper-overlap collision pairs are allowed automatically on every move while an item is held; contact phases near a modeled surface (under the machine, the serving-area shelf) allow the held item against that surface too. The held-item frame is dropped when the frame system is rebuilt (`reset_world`, `proceed`).

**Resting-surface seating.** Pickup resolves each detection's grasp **Z** from the surface the container stands on rather than the raw detected centroid Z (which depth noise pushes above or below the true base), using the configured container height (`cup_dimensions` / `glass_dimensions`). It finds the highest **static** Box in the framesystem whose world footprint lies directly beneath the detection and whose top face is below the detected centroid, then seats the container's base **1 mm** above that top — so the grasp centroid becomes `surfaceTop + 1 mm + height/2`, keeping the detected X/Y. "Static" means world-anchored (it moves rigidly with the world frame), so the moving arm, gripper, camera, and any held item are never mistaken for a surface; non-box and rotated geometries are bounded by their world axis-aligned extent. No framesystem changes or extra config are required — the resting surface is auto-detected. When no surface is found beneath a detection, pickup uses the raw detected Z unchanged.

**Serving-area placement.** Every finished cup (and, for iced coffee, the iced glass) is placed on a dedicated served-drinks shelf. Slots are tiled along the shelf's long axis (120 mm spacing, 60 mm margin from each end) on the midline of the shelf top — as many slots as the shelf length allows; the placement anchor is set so the held container's bottom rests on the shelf top: half the tracked container's height above the surface (so a taller iced glass is not driven into the shelf the way a fixed offset did), falling back to a fixed 30 mm on the rare paths where no held-item geometry is tracked. The anchor is composed with `serving_grab_relative_pose` (and `serving_approach_relative_pose` for the approach) to derive the actual `grip-point` pose, mirroring how the pickup composes its offsets onto the detected cup centroid. Slots are filled **sequentially (round-robin)**: a process-local counter advances one slot per placement and wraps back to the first slot when it reaches the end, on the assumption that by the time it wraps the earliest-placed cup has been picked up. If the arm cannot plan a path to a slot (approach or descent), that slot is **skipped and the next one is tried**, continuing around the ring until one is reachable (the order fails only if every slot is unreachable). There is no vision-based occupancy check — placement is fully decoupled from pickup observation. The counter resets to the first slot on module restart/reconfigure. Requires a `serving-area` (or `serving-area_origin`) Box geometry in the framesystem; this is checked at runtime, not at config time. An optional `serving-area-shield` Box obstacle may be added to the framesystem to enclose the standing-cup zone above the shelf: it stays a hard obstacle during the lateral carry (so the arm steers clear of cups already on the shelf) but is allowed to be passed through by the gripper, claws, and held container on the linearly constrained descent into a slot and the retreat back out. Size it with clearance above the cups so the approach pose stays outside it; when the frame is absent the allowances are inert and placement behaves as before.

**Iced coffee — required poses on the claws pose switcher (`claws_pose_switcher_name`):**

When `can_serve_iced` is enabled, the claws switch must additionally hold these poses (all moving the frame named by the switch's `component_name` — the `grip-point` frame). Calibrate them physically on the machine via `viam robot part motion get-pose`/`set-pose`. The glass itself is vision-detected (see the glass-observe switch below), so there are no static glass-pickup poses.

| Pose name              | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `ice_machine_approach` | Staged in front of the ice chute. |
| `ice_machine_dispense` | Glass held under the chute while the ice pin pulses. **If you re-teach this pose, re-check `ice_stop_row_px`**: with `ice_vision_enabled` the ice level is measured in raw image rows at this pose, and moving the glass in frame moves what those rows mean. `check_ice_level` prints both the surface row and the glass rim. |
| `staging_approach`     | Above the staging area where the glass rests during the pour. |
| `staging`              | Down in the staging area; the glass is set here to free the gripper for the pour, then re-grabbed and placed in the serving area. |

The iced latte adds nothing to the claws switch: the bottle is vision-detected (see the milk-observe switch below) and set back down at the spot it was detected at, the door is tracked through its hinge arc, and the milk pour is resolved against the staged glass like the espresso pour.

With `milk_options` set, the claws switch must also hold a pair of poses for each `spot`, taught with the fridge door **open**: `milk_<spot>_approach` (gripper open in front of the bottle at that spot) and `milk_<spot>_grab` (jaws around the bottle where it stands). They are checked at startup but not moved to yet.

**Staged-glass-relative pours.** The pour poses are not stored on the claws switch. `pour_approach`/`pour` (espresso) and `milk_pour_approach`/`milk_pour` (milk) are computed from `pour_approach_relative_pose`/`pour_relative_pose` and `milk_pour_approach_relative_pose`/`milk_pour_relative_pose`, applied to the **center of the staged glass's rim**. The rim is read off the `staged-glass` obstacle in the frame system — the glass `stage_glass` released, at the position it was actually set down — plus half that box's height along the glass axis. The poses are applied like the pickup offsets (translation along world axes from the rim, orientation absolute), but to the **held-item frame**: its origin is the grip point and its +Z is the held container's own axis, so the orientation is the cup's or bottle's tilt whatever angle the gripper grasped it at, and the pour pivots about the grip point. A pour also **fails when no container is modeled in the gripper**. Moving the staging area therefore only means re-teaching `staging`. A pour **fails when no glass is staged** (e.g. `pour_espresso` run by hand without a `stage_glass` first, or a glass staged without tracked geometry). Each resolution logs the rim position; to convert an absolute pour pose, subtract that position from its `x`/`y`/`z` and keep its orientation.

**Cup pickup — required poses on the camera-observe pose switcher (`camera_observe_pose_switcher_name`):**

Cup pickup is always vision-guided, so the dedicated camera-observe switch must hold one or more observation poses, all moving the camera frame `cam` (the switch's `component_name`). The switch must include a pose named `cup_observe`.

| Pose name           | Type                | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `cup_observe`       | Absolute world pose | Required. The primary view of the cup workspace and the home/recovery pose the arm returns to between grab attempts. |
| additional poses    | Absolute world pose | Optional extra vantages tried in turn, to recover cups occluded from the primary view or reachable only from a different angle. A pose is visited when earlier poses found no cup **or when the cups they saw were all unreachable**; the sweep stops as soon as a cup is grabbed. An unreachable pose logs a warning and is skipped. |

**Dynamic glass pickup — required poses on the glass-observe pose switcher (`glass_observe_pose_switcher_name`):**

When `can_serve_iced` is enabled, the dedicated glass-observe switch must hold one or more observation poses, all moving the `cam` frame. The switch must include a pose named `glass_observe`. Same sweep semantics as the cup observe switch.

| Pose name           | Type                | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `glass_observe`     | Absolute world pose | Required. The primary view of the glass storage area and the home/recovery pose between grab attempts. |
| additional poses    | Absolute world pose | Optional extra vantages tried only when earlier poses found no glass. |

**Dynamic milk pickup — required poses on the milk-observe pose switcher (`milk_observe_pose_switcher_name`):**

When `can_serve_iced_latte` is enabled, the dedicated milk-observe switch must hold one or more observation poses, all moving the `cam` frame. The switch must include a pose named `milk_observe`. Same sweep semantics as the cup observe switch — but calibrate these vantages with the fridge door **open**, since that is the only state the arm ever observes the milk in.

| Pose name           | Type                | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `milk_observe`      | Absolute world pose | Required. The primary view into the open fridge and the home/recovery pose between grab attempts. |
| additional poses    | Absolute world pose | Optional extra vantages tried only when earlier poses found no bottle. |

### DoCommand

**`prepare_order`** - Prepare a drink order with optional speech greetings. Supports `"espresso"` and `"lungo"`; `"decaf"`/`"decaf_lungo"` when `can_serve_decaf` is set, `"iced_coffee"` when `can_serve_iced` is set, and `"iced_latte"` when `can_serve_iced_latte` is set.

```json
{
  "prepare_order": {
    "drink": "espresso",
    "customer_name": "Alice",
    "modified_customer_name": "Alise",
    "customer_email": "alice@example.com",
    "initial_greeting": "optional custom greeting",
    "completion_statement": "optional custom completion message",
    "count": 3,
    "fulfillment": "pickup"
  }
}
```

Only `drink` is required. If `initial_greeting` is omitted, a random greeting is generated. If `customer_name` is provided, it personalizes the greeting and completion messages. `customer_name` must be the name the customer actually gave: it is the identity key every per-customer aggregation groups on (leaderboards, the daily digest's top customers). `modified_customer_name` is optional and exists for one reason — the kiosk deliberately misspells the name it shows and says, with a fresh misspelling each order, so that string can never identify a repeat customer. A caller that misspells sends the altered name here and the real one in `customer_name`; everything spoken and everything `get_queue` renders uses this field, falling back to `customer_name` when it is absent, which is what callers that never misspell (voice, operator) should do. If `customer_email` is provided **and** `customer_detector_name` is configured, the completed drink is credited to that customer's order history (see "the usual"). `fulfillment` is either `"pickup"` (default) or `"delivery"`; it is carried on each order through `get_queue`. Pickup orders keep the usual drink-ready announcement at cup handoff; delivery orders instead announce "…ready for delivery!" and send the delivery machine a `delivery_request` (see `send_delivery_message`). **Delivery orders require `customer_email`** — the delivery bot identifies the recipient by email, so an anonymous delivery is rejected at enqueue; pickup stays open to anonymous walk-ups. Orders are added to a queue and processed sequentially.

`count` is an optional positive integer (default 1) that enqueues N identical orders in one call — each gets its own UUID. The cap is `max_batch_size` (default 10). When `count > 1`, the response also includes `order_ids: [...]` (one per enqueued order) and `count`; existing `order_id` and `queue_position` keys still refer to the first order so existing callers keep working. To keep audio sane, the per-order "Order received…" line is replaced with a single consolidated batch announcement at submission time; the per-cup drink-ready announcement at cup handoff still fires once per order as each cup completes.

**`execute_action`** - Run a single coffee-making action by name, for manual step-by-step operation. An unknown name returns the full list of available actions in the error. Available actions:

- Brew cycle: `grind_coffee`, `grind_decaf`, `tamp_ground`, `lock_portafilter`, `unlock_portafilter`, `release_filter`, `grab_filter`, `brew_coffee`, plus the button actions for the configured machine (`turn_coffee_button_on` / `turn_coffee_button_off`, or `press_espresso_button` / `press_lungo_button` / `brew_lungo` under `has_separate_brew_buttons`), `set_cup_for_coffee`, `give_full_cup_to_customer` (place the finished cup in the serving area), `clean_portafilter`, `place_held` (place the currently held vessel in the serving area), `keepalive_purge` (one group-head purge on demand — available on the `has_separate_brew_buttons` machine whether or not `keepalive` is configured, so the `purge_*` poses can be verified before the loop is switched on).
- Iced coffee (require `can_serve_iced`): `fetch_glass`, `pulse_ice_pin`, `move_to_ice_dispense` (hold the glass under the chute without opening the pin), `dispense_ice`, `stage_glass`, `grab_brewed_cup`, `pour_espresso`, `grab_staged_glass`, `serve_iced_coffee` (the full iced sequence end-to-end), `check_ice_level` (measure the glass in the current camera frame and log it; no arm motion, no pin).
- Iced latte (require `can_serve_iced_latte`): `fetch_milk` (vision-grab the bottle from the **already open** fridge), `pour_milk` (pour the held bottle into the staged glass), `return_milk` (set the bottle back down where `fetch_milk` picked it up), `add_milk` (the whole fridge trip: open door → fetch → pour → return → close door), `serve_iced_latte` (the full iced-plus-milk sequence end-to-end). `fetch_milk`, `pour_milk` and `return_milk` are meant for stepping the sequence one move at a time while calibrating; each assumes the state the one before it leaves behind, and `return_milk` fails if no `fetch_milk` recorded a pickup position.
- Fridge door (requires `door_approach_relative_pose`): `open_door` (grip the handle and swing the door open — see below).

```json
{"execute_action": "grind_coffee"}
```

`with_glass: true` swaps the portafilter for a glass in the frame system for that one call — the filter subtree comes out, a box of `glass_dimensions` at the `glass_grab_relative_pose` centroid goes on the gripper — for stepping the iced sequence with a glass loaded into the jaws by hand. Without it the frame system models a portafilter that is not there and no glass that is, and the arm plans a path that drags the glass across the table, or cannot reach `ice_machine_dispense` at all. The swap is undone when the action ends, so pass the flag on **every** call of the sequence, not just the first.

Accepted by `move_to_ice_dispense`, `dispense_ice`, `stage_glass`, `pulse_ice_pin` and `check_ice_level`; anything else is refused, and the error names those five. The pickups (`fetch_glass`, `grab_staged_glass`, `grab_brewed_cup`) refuse it because they start with empty jaws: a stand-in there is a phantom sitting exactly where the real glass is about to be grasped, and every candidate fails to plan. Reach empty jaws with `lock_portafilter` then `release_filter` instead.

`glass_dimensions` / `glass_grab_relative_pose` are needed only for that empty-jaws case — when the gripper already models a held item, only the filter is dropped. A filter locked into the machine is modeled in the bayonet rather than on the claws, so it is left alone.

```json
{"execute_action": "move_to_ice_dispense", "with_glass": true}
```

`annotate: true` makes `check_ice_level`, `dispense_ice` and `pulse_ice_pin` save
an annotated JPEG of each frame they measure — scan band, stop row, both
methods' readings — into `save_motion_requests_dir`. An order's dispense saves
one without being asked; the flag only adds the hand-run actions, which are a
tuning loop fired as fast as it can be typed and would otherwise bury the
orders. Does nothing without `save_motion_requests_dir`, or on a dispense
without `ice_vision_enabled`.

```json
{"execute_action": "check_ice_level", "annotate": true}
```

**`cancel`** - Stop whatever is running, and nothing else. It cancels the shared sequence context so the run aborts at its next step boundary, calls `Stop` on the arm so the in-flight trajectory halts where it stands instead of playing out to its authored pose, and pauses the queue. No arm motion is planned, no gripper is opened, no state flag is cleared, and the cached frame system is left untouched: the portafilter stays wherever it was, a held cup stays in the jaws, pending orders stay queued.

```json
{"cancel": true}
```

Returns `{"status": "cancelled", "cancelled": true, "queue": "paused"}` — `cancelled` is `false` when nothing was running, and `queue` reports the real pause state. With nothing running, `cancel` still pauses the queue: it works as a pause button, so no new order starts until `proceed`.

To recover afterwards, put the machine back to its starting state by hand — a clean portafilter held in the claws, nothing else in the gripper, the fridge door shut — then send `proceed` to resume the queue. There is no command that does this for you.

**Pause after a fault.** An order that fails on its own — a genuine fault, not a `cancel` or `reset_world` — always pauses the queue exactly as `cancel` does. The next order would otherwise start from an unknown physical state, grinding a second dose onto used grounds or planning against a stale world, and not everything a fault leaves behind (a knocked-over cup, a half-finished pour) is something the service can see. An error log names any mid-cycle state still recorded — the portafilter locked in the group head or holding grounds, the filter frame locked to world, an item in the gripper, a glass staged, or the fridge door modeled open — and `get_queue` reports `is_paused: true`; recover the same way as after a cancel (put the machine right by hand, fridge door included, then `proceed`). A failed manually-stepped `execute_action` never pauses the queue. An order that crashes with a panic pauses the queue the same way. Once the service starts shutting down, every command that needs the arm is refused with `service closing`.

**Waiting for the arm.** The next order claims the arm before it starts. If a keepalive purge or a troubleshooting command holds the arm, or the queue is paused, the order stays pending, still visible in `get_queue` and still removable with `cancel_order`, and starts once the arm is free and the queue unpaused. A keepalive purge skips its turn the same way.

**`cancel_order`** - Drop one order out of the **backlog**, by ID. It is `clear_queue` narrowed to a single order, and it spares the drink on the arm for the same reason: the machine keeps making whatever it is making, the queue is not paused, no state flag is touched, and the orders behind the cancelled one move up a place. This is the customer-facing "actually, never mind" — `cancel` is the operator's stop button.

```json
{"cancel_order": "3f8c1e2a-…"}
```

Returns `{"status": "cancelled", "order_id": "3f8c1e2a-…", "customer_name": "Alice", "drink": "lungo", "remaining": 2}`, where `remaining` is the depth after the removal on the same count `get_queue` reports — backlog plus the order on the arm. The order is announced as cancelled when `conversational` is on.

It errors rather than guessing when the order can't be dropped:

- **The order on the arm** — it is in the queue's `current` slot, not the backlog, so a cancel aimed at it is refused rather than quietly missing. Use `cancel` to stop the machine instead.
- **An order that has already been made** — it is in the completed buffer `get_queue` shows for ~15s.
- **An unknown ID** — it was cancelled already, or never existed.

`get_queue` marks every order with a `cancellable` boolean saying which of these it is, so a UI can offer the action only where it will be accepted. Note this is not the same as "first in the list": the front of the backlog is cancellable precisely because nothing has started on it.

**`get_queue`** - Get the current order queue status.

```json
{"get_queue": true}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "orders": [
    {"id": "3f8c1e2a-…", "drink": "espresso", "customer_name": "Alice", "fulfillment": "pickup",
     "enqueued_at": "2026-09-17T09:12:03Z", "raw_step": "Brewing", "step_history": [],
     "completed_at": "", "cancellable": false},
    {"id": "9b21d740-…", "drink": "lungo", "customer_name": "Bob", "fulfillment": "pickup",
     "enqueued_at": "2026-09-17T09:12:40Z", "raw_step": "", "step_history": [],
     "completed_at": "", "cancellable": true}
  ],
  "is_paused": false,
  "is_busy": true,
  "arm_holder": "order queue"
}
```

`arm_holder` names what currently holds the arm — `order queue`, `keepalive purge`, `reset_world`, `execute_action open_door` and so on — and is empty when the arm is free. A command refused because the arm is busy names the holder in its error too.

`count` is how many drinks still have to be made — the backlog plus the one on the arm. Orders that have finished stay in the list with `completed_at` set for ~15s so a UI can render a "Ready!" card without diffing polls, but they don't count toward the depth. `cancellable` says whether `cancel_order` would accept this order.

**`proceed`** - Re-sync the recorded world with the real one, and resume queue processing after a pause — from a `cancel`, or from a fault that left the machine mid-cycle (see "Pause after a fault" above).

The frame system is rebuilt from the framesystem service on every `proceed`, discarding whatever an interrupted order left mid-cycle — a filter frame reparented to world by `lock_portafilter`, a held-item geometry, a staged-glass obstacle. This is unconditional because the next order's opportunistic refresh deliberately declines to rebuild while a held item or locked filter is recorded, and a paused queue is not the only way those mutations are stranded: a failed manually-stepped `execute_action` leaves them behind with the queue still running. If the rebuild fails, nothing resumes and a paused queue stays paused.

The **recorded fridge-door angle is cleared too**, so the rebuilt world has a shut door like every other configured obstacle. `proceed` is the operator saying the machine has been put right by hand, and that includes the fridge. Rebuilding a model still cannot shut a real door — which is why a rebuild never clears the angle on its own, and every other one re-applies it — so this is an assertion you are making, not a check the service can run.

> ⚠️ **Shut the fridge before sending `proceed`.** If the door is really still open, the model now claims it is closed and the next plan will route the arm straight through the panel. A `proceed` that forgets an angle says so: a warning in the logs, and a `fridge_door_cleared_degs` field in the response (absent when the door was already shut).

The pause is only released if there is one — `proceed` on a running queue rebuilds the world and reports `resumed: false`. Releasing the pause *is* clearing the queue's paused flag, done by `proceed` itself: any cancel pauses the queue, including one that interrupts an `execute_action` or a keepalive purge with no order in flight, and such a pause has no order-queue goroutine waiting to hear about it. Two `proceed`s racing therefore resume once, and the second reports `resumed: false`. `proceed` refuses outright while a sequence is still running (including one that is unwinding from a cancel): the frame system cannot be swapped under a goroutine that is planning with it.

Because the rebuild forgets the modeled contents of the gripper without opening the gripper, `proceed` is the wrong command when the jaws really are holding something — a portafilter or cup a manually-stepped `execute_action` picked up. Take it out by hand first, and only then `proceed`. A `proceed` that forgets a held item logs a warning saying so.

```json
{"proceed": true}
```

Returns `{"status": "resumed", "resumed": true, "frame_system_reset": true}`, or `{"status": "reset", "resumed": false, "frame_system_reset": true}` when the queue was not paused. A `fridge_door_cleared_degs` field is added when the rebuild forgot a door angle.

**`clear_queue`** - Drop the backlog of orders still waiting to be made. The order currently being brewed keeps running and stays in the queue, and recently-completed orders keep showing as ready. Use `cancel` to stop an order mid-brew, or `reset_world` to cancel and wipe the queue entirely.

```json
{"clear_queue": true}
```

Returns `{"status": "cleared", "removed": 2, "kept_current": false}`. When an order was being brewed, `kept_current` is `true` and `kept_current_order_id` names the order that was spared.

**`cleanup_pending_clips`** - Attempt a video save for any remaining pending-clip records under `data_dir`, removing each record only once its save succeeds; a failed save (including one that exceeds the 60s save timeout) keeps the record for the next run. Catches clips whose live save was interrupted (process died during the post-roll wait) or failed (e.g. cam storage unavailable). Records younger than one full clip window plus a segment-flush margin are skipped, so an in-progress order is not double-saved. If records exist but `cam_storage_mux_name` is unset, the command returns an error and leaves them in place so they can be recovered once the mux is configured again. Intended to be invoked via a Viam scheduled job.

```json
{"cleanup_pending_clips": true}
```

Returns `{"saved": 1, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0}`.

**`send_delivery_message`** - Run a DoCommand on the peer machine's service named by `delivery_handler_name` and return its response — the manual test hook for the delivery channel. The value is forwarded to the peer **verbatim**, so it must be a non-empty object using the command vocabulary the peer's own service understands. Errors when `delivery_handler_name` is unset, the value isn't an object, or the peer is unreachable (10s timeout).

```json
{"send_delivery_message": {"delivery_request": {"order_id": "test", "order_timestamp": "2026-07-16T15:04:05Z", "cup_type": "cup", "customer_email": "alice@example.com", "pickup_position": 1}}}
```

Returns `{"sent": true, "peer_response": {...}}` where `peer_response` is whatever the peer's service returned.

In normal operation this fires automatically: when a `fulfillment: "delivery"` order's drink lands in the serving area, the coffee service sends the peer a `delivery_request` with the shape above — `order_id`/`order_timestamp` (RFC3339 enqueue time) from the order, `customer_email` (required for delivery orders, so always non-empty here), `cup_type` — the container label, `"glass"` for iced drinks and `"cup"` for everything else (same labels the cup-pickup pipeline uses) — and `pickup_position` the 0-based serving-area slot the drink was placed in. The send is deliberately synchronous: the service waits (up to 10s) for the bot's `{"received": true}` acknowledgment before the drink-ready announcement, so an unconfirmed handoff is logged rather than assumed. Failures never fail the order — the drink is already in the serving area. The channel is otherwise one-way: the coffee machine observes its own serving slots by camera rather than waiting for delivery progress reports.

**`send_daily_summary`** - Post a Slack digest of the orders from the last 24 hours. Normally fired on a schedule by viam-server's job manager (see "Daily order summary in Slack" below); calling it by hand is how you test the digest off-schedule. Requires both `slack_notifier_name` and `order_sensor_name`.

```json
{"send_daily_summary": true}
```

The command takes no options — the window is a rolling 24 hours ending now, and timestamps render in the host's timezone. Returns `{"sent": true, "orders": N}`.

**`reset_world`** - Recover the service to a clean idle state from anywhere. In order: cancels any running sequence (waiting for it to actually stop), clears the queue (pending + recently completed), rebuilds the cached frame system from the framesystem service (discarding mid-cycle mutations like a portafilter frame reparented to world by `lock_portafilter`), forgets that the fridge door is standing open, and releases the queue pause left by a cancel or a fault. Safe to call from any state — each step is skipped when not applicable. The queue clear and rebuild run holding the arm, so if another sequence (a manual action, a keep-alive purge) claims it first, `reset_world` fails without changing anything past the cancel — send it again. Does not move the arm — if you want to re-home, run `execute_action` afterward.

> ⚠️ `reset_world` asserts that the physical world matches the configured frame system. Like `proceed`, it clears the recorded fridge-door angle, so **shut the door by hand before running it** — otherwise the model believes the panel is closed while it stands open, and the next plan will route the arm straight through it.

```json
{"reset_world": true}
```

Returns `{"status": "reset", "cancelled": true, "cleared": 2, "unpaused": true}` — fields reflect which steps actually fired.

**`run_cup_flow`** - Exercise the full cup-handling path without brewing, `count` times. Each iteration sweeps the camera-observe poses grabbing the first reachable cup across them (closest-first, continuing past a pose whose cups are all unreachable), sets it under the machine, retrieves it, and places it on the next sequential served-shelf slot (round-robin). Intended for tuning the observe-pose sweep and shelf placement on hardware.

Assumes the portafilter has been **physically removed** from the claws — the flow never touches portafilter state. Honors `cancel`. The value is the iteration count (`>= 1`); `true` runs a single iteration.

```json
{"run_cup_flow": 5}
```

Returns `{"status": "complete", "iterations": 5}`.

**`execute_action: open_door`** - Grip the fridge handle and pull the door open along its hinge arc, then release and retract, leaving the door open. The door is a static obstacle (`fridge-door`) whose root frame origin sits on the hinge; `open_door` sweeps the door angle in software (`door_open_angle_degs`, default 90°, in `door_pivot_degrees_per_step` increments, default 10°), re-placing the door obstacle at each step so the grasp frame (`door_grasp_frame_name`, default `fridge-handle-ball`) and the door panel track the real swing and collision-checking stays honest. The gripper aims its `grip-point` frame at the grasp frame's **center**, with the orientation from `door_approach_relative_pose`; the pre-grasp standoff is that same relative pose's translation offset from the ball center (resolved against the live ball frame, like `cup_approach_relative_pose` against a detected cup). Neither approach nor grasp is a separately-authored switch pose. The traverse to the standoff plans freely; the standoff-to-ball insertion and the post-release exit are **linear** (`defaultApproachConstraint`), the same split dynamic cup pickup uses — the gripper/grasp-frame pair is exempt from collision checking during the pull, so an unconstrained insertion could arc in through the handle bar and still plan clean. The jaws are opened at the standoff (not before — an open gripper has a wider collision silhouette than a closed one) and closed once at the ball center. Through the swing the gripper tracks the ball's **point** exactly and yaws the tool about world Z by `door_grasp_yaw_ratio` x the door angle (default `-1`, i.e. the tool turns against the swing, which keeps the wrist reachable as the handle travels). The sweep is planned without a linear constraint, so the waypoints are the only thing telling the planner how the tool should be pointed along the arc — hence the explicit orientation. The retract standoff is yawed by the sweep's total turn for the same reason, so the exit backs off the handle rather than into the now-open panel. Contact between the gripper and the grasp frame is allowed during the pull. After the swing it releases and retracts to the same relative-pose standoff resolved against the ball's open position, leaving the door open. Requires only `door_approach_relative_pose` to be set — no poses are authored on the switch for this action. Gated like every action (one sequence at a time) and honors `cancel`; the frame system is rebuilt on exit so the door mutation never leaks.

```json
{"execute_action": "open_door"}
```

**`execute_action: close_door`** - The reverse of `open_door`: grip the open door's handle and push the panel back shut, then release and retract. Same grasp derivation, `door_grasp_yaw_ratio` orientation tracking, per-step obstacle re-placement, and cancellation — only the target angle differs (0° instead of `door_open_angle_degs`). The yaw follows the travel direction, so a close unwinds exactly what the open wound up.

**Where the modeled door lives between actions.** Both actions sweep from wherever the door currently stands to their target, and the service remembers the angle. The frame system rebuilds the door at its authored *shut* transform, so that recorded angle is re-applied after every rebuild — opening the fridge does not close it, and the panel must stay modeled where it physically is or later plans will route the arm through it. Only angles the arm actually reached are recorded, so an aborted sweep leaves the model at the door's real position rather than the intended one. The record is cleared only by the two commands in which an operator asserts the world is as configured — `proceed` and `reset_world` — so shut the door by hand before sending either.

```json
{"execute_action": "close_door"}
```

Returns `{"status": "complete", "action": "open_door"}`.

### Iced latte: the milk step

An `iced_latte` is an `iced_coffee` with one extra stretch spliced into the serving step. Everything up to and including staging the iced glass is identical; then, before the espresso is fetched, with the gripper free and the iced glass standing in the staging area:

1. **Open the fridge** — the `open_door` sweep, so the modeled panel tracks the real one and every plan that follows routes around it.
2. **Fetch the bottle** — the same vision pickup cups and glasses use, against `milk_vision_service_name` and the vantages on `milk_observe_pose_switcher_name`. Detections are seated on the shelf beneath them (resting-surface seating), ranked closest-first, and grabbed via `milk_approach_relative_pose` / `milk_grab_relative_pose`. **The world centroid it was grasped at is recorded.** If no bottle is seen — or none can be reached — the arm asks the customer to put the milk back on its shelf (or nudge it) and retries, exactly like a missing cup.
3. **Pour** — carry the bottle to `milk_pour_approach` and tilt to `milk_pour` as a pivot (lifting the bottle as it tips if `milk_pour_relative_pose` sits higher than the approach), the same pour the espresso gets. The dwell at the tilted pose (`milk_pour_sec`) is the milk dose; the staged glass stays a hard obstacle throughout.
4. **Put the bottle back** — not at an authored pose, but at the centroid step 2 recorded, with the same two offsets composed onto it. Where the milk stands in the fridge changes every time somebody puts it away, so the return is the grasp replayed rather than a spot to calibrate.
5. **Shut the fridge** — the `close_door` sweep.

Then the sequence rejoins the iced flow: grab the espresso cup from under the machine, pour it over the ice and milk, place the empty cup in the serving area, then re-grab the glass and place it beside it. As with iced coffee, two serving slots are consumed per order (the empty espresso cup, then the latte).

The door is opened once and closed once, so the fridge stands open for the pour — a few seconds of open door in exchange for halving the door sweeps, which are the slowest and most failure-prone part of the trip.

**When a milk step fails.** The arm does not try to shut the door itself: it may still be holding the bottle, and a sweep needs the gripper for the handle. So the door is left where it stands, the model keeps recording that angle, and the error says so. Take the bottle out of the gripper if it is holding one and put the rest of the machine back to its starting state by hand. Then shut the door and send `proceed`, which is what declares it shut again.

**`action`** - Control the gripper. Supported values: `"open_gripper"`, `"close_gripper"`.

```json
{"action": "open_gripper"}
```

Returns `{"status": "opened"}` or `{"status": "closed", "grabbed": true}`. Like the other troubleshooting commands, it is refused while another sequence holds the arm.

### Keeping the machine at brew temperature

The Breville BES920 drops into POWER SAVE after one hour idle and powers off completely after four, and the one-hour sleep cannot be disabled in its settings. A brew started on a sleeping machine is refused with three beeps, so the arm serves an empty cup and records it as a success. Two things prevent that, and both are needed:

1. **Program the machine's own Auto Start.** `MENU` → `AUTO START` → `ON` → a time ~15 minutes before people arrive. This handles the cold morning in hardware, and the same time goes in `keepalive.auto_start`. Note Auto Start has no day-of-week setting, so it also fires at weekends; the machine's own Auto Off shuts it down again after four hours.
2. **Configure `keepalive`.** During the window, the arm holds the 1 CUP button for about a second whenever nothing has run water through the machine for `after_min`. This is Breville's documented group-head purge, and it resets the machine's idle timer so it never leaves brew temperature. The filter pose switcher needs `purge_approach` and `purge_press` for this.

Because a purge is the one arm motion nobody requested, it announces itself through `speech_service_name` and waits 5 seconds before moving, regardless of `conversational` — it's a safety notice rather than status narration. The arm returns to `home` when the purge finishes.

The arm never presses POWER — per the manual, pressing POWER while the machine is in POWER SAVE turns it *off*. The consequence is that this cannot recover a machine that is genuinely powered down: if Auto Start does not fire, or someone switches the machine off, every order that day will brew cold and be recorded as a success. Detecting that needs a machine-state sensor, which is not part of this feature.

Water from each purge goes to the drip tray and is counted in the `drip_tray_brews` usage-sensor field, so empty the tray on the counter rather than on brew count alone.
### Daily order summary in Slack

Once `slack_notifier_name` and `order_sensor_name` are both configured, `send_daily_summary` posts a Block Kit digest of the last 24 hours of orders to the same channel the failure alerts go to. A quiet 24 hours still posts a short "No orders in the last 24 hours" line, which is what keeps a quiet channel distinguishable from a broken digest.

The message reads:

```
:coffee: Orders in the last 24 hours

:clock3: 17m20s brewing  ·  :white_check_mark: 6/8 succeeded  ·  :coffee: 8 orders

Succeeded                 6
Faulted                   1
Cancelled by operator     1
───────────────────────────
Total                     8

:trophy: Alice — 3  ·  :sleeping: 1 decaf  ·  :fire: 12 in a row

:coffee: *Drinks*
• espresso — 4 (avg 2m12s)
• iced_latte — 2 (avg 4m10s)

:x: *Faults by step*
• Locking portafilter — 1

:clock3: Sun 5:30 PM – Mon 5:30 PM EDT · order a coffee
```

`:trophy:` names whoever ordered most. **Walk-ups who skip the name screen are left out of it entirely** — pooled under one "anonymous" label they would win most days and say nothing, so the leaderboard counts only named customers and consequently does not sum to the order total. Everyone tied at the top is named rather than one of them picked arbitrarily, since a two-order tie is the normal case on a quiet day. Every attempt counts toward a customer's tally whether or not the machine managed it: they asked for a drink, and the failure is the machine's record rather than theirs.

The headline line carries the three numbers worth having in a notification preview, each with an emoji the sections below reuse for the same idea — `:clock3:` for time, `:coffee:` for drinks, `:x:` for faults. The outcome counts are a fixed-width table in a code fence: Slack has no table block that renders reliably across clients, and a code fence is the only place it honours column alignment. Emoji do not render inside one, which is why they sit on the line above rather than in the rows. Every digest links the [ordering app](https://beanjamin_viam.viamapplications.com/) in its footer.

The window is a rolling 24 hours ending when the digest runs, not a calendar day. Run the job once a day and consecutive digests tile exactly: every order is reported once, evening orders included, and none is counted twice. A calendar-day window would instead have stopped at the moment the digest fired and silently dropped anything brewed after it.

When `usage_sensor_name` is also configured the digest adds a **current streak** — the machine's run of consecutive successful orders, read live from the sensor's `successful_consecutive_orders` counter. It is deliberately not a windowed figure: any fault or operator cancel resets it whenever it happens, so it describes the machine right now and can span days. The field is omitted entirely when no usage sensor is wired in or the read fails, rather than shown as `0`, which would read as a streak that had just broken.

Brew times are reported **per drink**, in the drinks breakdown (`• iced_latte — 7 (avg 4m12s)`), not as one number across all of them. An iced latte's fridge trip runs minutes longer than an espresso, so a single mean would track the day's drink mix rather than the machine, and a slow day would be indistinguishable from a latte-heavy one. A drink whose every attempt failed shows its count with no timing rather than `0s`. The grid still carries **total brewing** — a sum stays meaningful across mixed drinks, since it measures how long the machine was working.

The numbers do not come from anything the service keeps in memory. They are read back out of the cloud tabular store that the order sensor syncs into, using `QueryTabularDataForResource` from the RDK's `module` package, so a module restart or reconfigure inside the window loses nothing. **This requires data capture to be enabled and syncing on the order-sensor component** — without it the digest is honestly empty rather than wrong.

**Scheduling lives in the machine config, not in this module.** Add a `jobs` entry so viam-server's job manager calls the command on a cron; changing the hour is then a config edit rather than a module rebuild and redeploy:

```json
"jobs": [
  {
    "name": "daily-order-summary",
    "schedule": "CRON_TZ=America/New_York 30 17 * * *",
    "resource": "coffee",
    "method": "DoCommand",
    "command": { "send_daily_summary": true }
  }
]
```

> ⚠️ **`CRON_TZ=` is the only timezone that matters here, and it is not optional.** The job manager builds its scheduler without a location, so a bare `"30 17 * * *"` fires at 17:30 in whatever timezone the *host* is set to — four hours off from New York, and silently so. Omit it only if the host's own timezone is already the one you want. The digest prints the window it covered in its footer (`Sun 5:30 PM – Mon 5:30 PM EDT`), which is where a wrong firing time shows up.

**Fire it daily.** The 24-hour window only tiles against a daily schedule. Restricting the cron to weekdays with `1-5` leaves a gap — Monday's digest reaches back to Sunday evening, so everything brewed Friday evening through Sunday afternoon is never reported by any run. Keep `* * *` even if the machine only gets used on weekdays; a quiet weekend costs two "No orders" lines.

`method` must be `DoCommand` — the job manager has a fast path for it that calls the service directly instead of going through gRPC reflection.

One consequence worth knowing: a job that fails is only a log line plus an entry in the job's history; nothing is posted to Slack, so a broken digest looks the same as a channel nobody used. The "No orders in the last 24 hours" heartbeat is the cheap check against that.

**Prerequisite:** the query authenticates from the `VIAM_API_KEY` / `VIAM_API_KEY_ID` environment variables, which viam-server only injects into modules when the machine config carries an api-key auth handler. Without one, the digest fails at call time with an auth error while everything else about the service keeps working.

### Pose reference

Which poses the service can reach, and which frame each moves. The frame is the switch's `component_name`; the table records what those switches are expected to carry.

**`filter` frame** — the `pose_switcher_name` switch

| Pose | Used for | Required when |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| `grinder_approach`, `grinder_activate` | grind | always |
| `decaf_grinder_approach`, `decaf_grinder_activate` | decaf grind | `can_serve_decaf` |
| `tamper_approach`, `tamper_activate` | tamp | always |
| `coffee_approach`, `coffee_in`, `coffee_locked_final` | lock the portafilter | always |
| `coffee_shake`, `coffee_shake_left` | dislodge a stuck puck while unlocking (the two lean opposite ways) | `portafilter_shake_sec > 0` |
| `close_to_cleaning`, `approach_to_cleaning_scrapper`, `cleaning_scrapper_active`, `approach_to_cleaning_brush`, `cleaning_brush_active` | clean | always |
| `purge_approach`, `purge_press` | hold the 1 CUP button to keep the machine at brew temperature | `keepalive` is configured |
| `home` | end of cycle | always |

**`grip-point` frame** — the `claws_pose_switcher_name` switch

| Pose | Used for | Required when |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| `filter_released`, `coffee_locked_final` | hand the portafilter off and re-grab it | always |
| `coffee_button_approach`, `coffee_button_on`, `coffee_button_off` | hold the toggle down through the brew | `has_separate_brew_buttons: false` |
| `espresso_button_approach`/`_press`, `lungo_button_approach`/`_press` | poke the per-shot buttons | `has_separate_brew_buttons: true` |
| `cup_under_machine_approach`, `cup_ready_for_coffee` | place and retrieve the cup | always |
| `ice_machine_approach`, `ice_machine_dispense`, `staging_approach`, `staging` | iced coffee | `can_serve_iced` |
| `milk_<spot>_approach`, `milk_<spot>_grab` (one pair per `spot` in `milk_options`) | checked at startup; not moved to yet | `can_serve_iced_latte` with `milk_options` set |

The milk bottle needs no authored pickup or return poses: it is vision-detected
inside the fridge and set back down at the centroid it was grasped at. Neither pour
has a switch pose: both are resolved against the staged glass (see
**Staged-glass-relative pours**).

**`cam` frame** — the observe switches

| Pose | Switch | Required when |
| ---- | ------ | ------------- |
| `cup_observe` | `camera_observe_pose_switcher_name` | always |
| `glass_observe` | `glass_observe_pose_switcher_name` | `can_serve_iced` |
| `milk_observe` | `milk_observe_pose_switcher_name` | `can_serve_iced_latte` |

Both observe switches sweep **every** pose they carry, so additional vantages alongside these are used even though only these are required.

Note that `coffee_locked_final` exists on both the filter and claws switches as two genuinely different poses in two different frames.

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:dial-control-motion`

**API:** `rdk:service:generic`

Translates Stream Deck dial inputs into relative arm motions. Each dial tick contributes a step (mm for translations, degrees for rotations) along the chosen axis. The service tracks the absolute dial position between calls to determine direction (handling rollover at the dial range boundaries) and accumulates pending motion in a per-axis bucket. A background drain loop flushes accumulated motion to the arm at `drain_interval_ms`, applying a per-axis acceleration multiplier — single detents stay at 1× for fine control, while rapid spinning amplifies motion non-linearly.

### DoCommand

**`dial_move_x`** / **`dial_move_y`** / **`dial_move_z`** - Enqueue a translation along the named axis from a Stream Deck dial value. The first call for a given axis calibrates the dial position and does not move the arm.

```json
{"dial_move_x": 50}
```

Returns `{"status": "queued", "axis": "x", "step": 5.0}` or `{"status": "dial_initialized", "axis": "x", "position": 50}` on first call.

**`dial_move_orientation`** - Enqueue a translation along the current tool orientation vector.

```json
{"dial_move_orientation": 50}
```

**`dial_move_rx`** / **`dial_move_ry`** / **`dial_move_rz`** - Enqueue a rotation around the named world axis. Step magnitude is in degrees per detent.

```json
{"dial_move_rx": 50}
```

**`toggle_axis_mode`** - Flip the dial-mode for X/Y/Z dials between translation and rotation. Bind this to a Stream Deck button to repurpose the dials live. While in rotation mode, `dial_move_x` is routed to `rx` (and similarly for y/z); `dial_move_orientation` is unaffected.

```json
{"toggle_axis_mode": true}
```

Returns `{"status": "toggled", "axis_mode": "rotation"}`.

**`set_axis_mode`** - Set the mode explicitly (idempotent). Value must be `"translation"` or `"rotation"`.

```json
{"set_axis_mode": "rotation"}
```

Returns `{"status": "set", "axis_mode": "rotation"}`.

**`get_axis_mode`** - Read the current mode without changing it.

```json
{"get_axis_mode": true}
```

Returns `{"axis_mode": "translation"}`.

> **Removed:** `dial_move_speed` no longer exists. The new acceleration model (`accel_threshold_count` / `accel_max_multiplier` / `accel_exponent`) replaces it. Stream Deck profiles bound to `dial_move_speed` will receive an error and need to be remapped.

---

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:maintenance-sensor`

**API:** `rdk:component:sensor`

Reports whether the system is safe for maintenance. Returns `is_safe: true` only when the arm is not moving, no order is running, and the queue is empty. Useful for gating maintenance workflows or triggering alerts.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "coffee_service_name": "coffee",
  "arm_name": "my-arm"
}
```

| Name                 | Type   | Required | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `coffee_service_name`| string | Yes      | Name of the `viam:beanjamin:coffee` service to query for queue/running state. |
| `arm_name`           | string | Yes      | Name of the arm component to check for physical movement. |

### Readings

Returns a single reading:

```json
{"is_safe": true}
```

`is_safe` is `false` when any of the following are true:
- The arm is physically moving
- An order is currently running
- There are orders in the queue

---

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:order-sensor`

**API:** `rdk:component:sensor`

Receives a summary of each order attempt from the `viam:beanjamin:coffee` service. Configure the coffee service with `order_sensor_name` set to this component’s name, and add this sensor under the coffee resource’s **depends_on**.

**Each reading is returned at most once** from `Readings`. When there is no queued reading, `Readings` returns [`data.ErrNoCaptureToStore`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.viam.com/rdk/data#pkg-variables) (and a nil readings map), which Data Management treats as “nothing to store” until the next order completes.

### Configuration

```json
{}
```

No attributes. Wire the sensor through the coffee service as described above.

### Readings

With nothing queued, `Readings` returns **`ErrNoCaptureToStore`** and no readings map (clients should use `data.IsNoCaptureToStoreError` in Go).

After each order attempt completes (success, failure, or panic), the **next** `Readings` call returns something like:

```json
{
  "order_id": "<uuid>",
  "drink": "espresso",
  "customer_name": "Alice",
  "modified_customer_name": "Alise",
  "order_ok": true,
  "operator_cancelled": false,
  "error_message": "",
  "failed_step": "",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "decaf": false,
  "start_time": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000000000Z",
  "end_time": "2026-04-01T12:02:05.000000000Z",
  "duration_ms": 125000
}
```

`start_time` and `end_time` are UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps: wall clock from when queue processing begins for that order through when the attempt finishes (greeting, drink prep, completion speech). `duration_ms` matches `end_time − start_time`. On failure, `order_ok` is `false` and `error_message` is set; panics use a `panic: ...` message. When successful, `error_message` is an empty string.

The remaining fields exist to support observability (per-step error rates and failure investigation):

- **`customer_name`** — the name the customer gave, and the key to group on for per-customer aggregation. **Never group on `modified_customer_name`.**
- **`modified_customer_name`** — the misspelling this particular order was shown and told, recorded so a support question ("my cup said Alise") can be traced back to an order. It is re-rolled per order, so grouping on it gives one customer a separate bucket per drink. Empty when the caller never misspelled. Readings written before this field existed have a misspelling in `customer_name` itself and cannot be regrouped.
- **`failed_step`** — the step label the order errored at (e.g. `"Brewing"`, `"Grinding"`), matching the `setStep` labels surfaced through `get_queue`. Empty on success. Count readings by `failed_step` to see where orders die.
- **`operator_cancelled`** — `true` when the failure was an operator `cancel` (a `context.Canceled` interruption), not a genuine fault. **Exclude these from step error-rate metrics** so intentional cancellations don't inflate failure counts. `failed_step` is still populated (it marks where the cancel interrupted).
- **`trace_id`** — the OpenTelemetry trace ID for the order. Use it to jump from a failed reading to the order's full distributed trace (every motion plan and step span). Empty if no trace context was present.
- **`decaf`** — whether the order took the decaf grinder branch, so you can tell why a given step ran (or didn't) without cross-referencing the coffee service config. Derived from the drink.

A per-step error rate is then `count(failed_step == X AND NOT operator_cancelled) / count(all orders)`.

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:customer-detector`

**API:** `rdk:service:generic`

Identifies return customers using facial recognition. Wraps the [`viam:vision:face-identification`](https://github.com/viam-modules/viam-face-identification) vision service to register customer faces (associated with a name and email) and later identify them when they return.

### Prerequisites

- A configured camera component.
- The [`viam:vision:face-identification`](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/face-identification) module added as a vision service, with its `picture_directory` pointing to `<data_dir>/known_faces`.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "camera_name": "<string>",
  "vision_service_name": "<string>",
  "data_dir": "<string>",
  "confidence_threshold": <float>,
  "min_face_area_fraction": <float>
}
```

| Name                     | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `camera_name`            | string | Yes      | Name of the camera component used to capture customer photos.                                   |
| `vision_service_name`    | string | Yes      | Name of the `face-identification` vision service dependency.                                    |
| `data_dir`               | string | Yes      | Directory for storing known face images and customer records. Must match the vision service's `picture_directory` parent (i.e. the vision service's `picture_directory` should be `<data_dir>/known_faces`). |
| `confidence_threshold`   | float  | No       | Minimum confidence score to consider a face match. Defaults to `0.5`.                           |
| `min_face_area_fraction` | float  | No       | Minimum fraction of the (center-cropped) image area a detected face bounding box must cover to be considered for identification. Defaults to `0.08` (face spans ~28% of the frame linearly). |

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "camera_name": "customer-cam",
  "vision_service_name": "face-detector",
  "data_dir": "/data/customers",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.6,
  "min_face_area_fraction": 0.08
}
```

The face-identification vision service should be configured with `picture_directory` set to `/data/customers/known_faces` (matching the `data_dir` above). Both modules must share this path so the customer-detector can write face images that the vision service reads.

### DoCommand

**`register_customer`** — Capture a single photo from the camera and stage it for the customer's name and email. Call this multiple times during a registration session to capture different angles (front, left, right, etc.). Staged photos live under `<data_dir>/pending_faces/<email>/`, outside the face-identification `picture_directory`, so nobody is enrolled until `finish_registration` commits them; `cancel_registration` discards them. The optional `pose` (a non-negative integer) names the capture slot, so retaking a pose replaces its photo instead of adding another.

The email must be a bare address (`alice@example.com` — no display name, no surrounding whitespace, at most 254 characters, no `/` or `\`), because it names the customer's face directory. `register_customer` and `finish_registration` reject anything else, and `remove_customer` refuses to delete an image directory that is not directly under `<data_dir>/known_faces`.

```json
{
  "register_customer": {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "pose": 0
  }
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "registered": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "image_path": "/data/customers/pending_faces/alice@example.com/face_1.jpeg"
}
```

**`finish_registration`** — Call once the customer confirms their photos. Moves the staged faces into `<data_dir>/known_faces/<email>/`, saves the customer record (keeping any order history from an earlier registration), and triggers the vision service to recompute its embeddings so the new faces become recognisable.

```json
{"finish_registration": "alice@example.com"}
```

Returns:

```json
{"email": "alice@example.com", "name": "Alice Smith", "face_images": 5}
```

**`cancel_registration`** — Discard the customer's staged photos, e.g. when they skip or back out of face registration. Faces committed by an earlier `finish_registration` are untouched. Safe to call more than once. Staged photos are also discarded whenever the service restarts.

```json
{"cancel_registration": "alice@example.com"}
```

Returns:

```json
{"cancelled": "alice@example.com", "discarded": 3}
```

**`identify_customer`** — Capture a photo and attempt to match the face against registered customers.

```json
{"identify_customer": true}
```

Returns (match found):

```json
{
  "identified": true,
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "is_registered": true
}
```

Returns (no match):

```json
{
  "identified": false,
  "message": "no known customer detected",
  "num_detections": 0
}
```

**`list_customers`** — List all registered customer emails.

```json
{"list_customers": true}
```

Returns:

```json
{"customers": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"], "count": 2}
```

**`remove_customer`** — Remove a customer and their face images.

```json
{"remove_customer": "alice@example.com"}
```

Returns:

```json
{"removed": "alice@example.com"}
```

**`record_order`** — Append a completed drink to a customer's order history (the data behind "the usual"). The coffee service calls this automatically after a successful brew when `customer_detector_name` is configured and the order carried a `customer_email`; you can also call it directly. An unknown email is a no-op (not an error), so it's safe to call for anonymous walk-ups.

```json
{"record_order": {"email": "alice@example.com", "drink": "espresso"}}
```

Returns:

```json
{"recorded": true, "email": "alice@example.com", "drink": "espresso"}
```

**`get_usual`** — Return a customer's usual drink, derived from their recorded order history. Returns `{"has_usual": false}` when the customer is unknown or has no history.

```json
{"get_usual": "alice@example.com"}
```

Returns:

```json
{"has_usual": true, "drink": "espresso", "count": 7}
```

**`get_info`** — Return static service info. Currently `{"camera_name": <short name>}` for the camera the detector is wired to.

```json
{"get_info": true}
```

### `Status()`

`Status()` reports the customer currently in front of the camera and their usual, so a poller (notably `viam:conversation-bundle:voice-command`'s `command_status`) can greet them by name and offer their usual. It runs a best-effort identification and folds in `get_usual`; results are cached briefly so per-turn polling doesn't re-run the vision model on every call.

When a registered customer is recognized:

```json
{
  "recognized": true,
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "usual_drink": "espresso",
  "usual_count": 7
}
```

Otherwise: `{"recognized": false}`.

### Storage

Customer records (name, email, image directory, order history) are persisted to `<data_dir>/customers.json`. Order history is capped at the most recent 50 entries per customer. Face images are stored under `<data_dir>/known_faces/<email>/` — one subdirectory per customer, which is the directory structure the face-identification vision service expects. Unconfirmed captures are staged under `<data_dir>/pending_faces/` and never reach `known_faces` unless `finish_registration` is called. Registering the same customer multiple times adds additional face samples, improving recognition accuracy.

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:crm`

**API:** `rdk:service:generic`

Customer profiles keyed by email. Today a profile is a loyalty account: the coffee service (with `crm_name` set) credits one point per completed drink whose order carried a `customer_email`, and customers contribute their points toward **rewards** — improvements to the barista setup — configured here. Everyone's contributions to a reward pool together; once they reach its target the reward is unlocked, locked against further contributions, and announced on Slack. Contributions are final.

Emails are matched case-insensitively (stored lowercased), so the address typed at the kiosk and the one on a Viam account land on the same profile. The web app's rewards page is `/?view=rewards&partId=<part id>` (linked from the fleet dashboard as `[rewards →]`); it reads the viewer's email from their Viam access token and shows and spends that email's points.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "data_dir": "<string>",
  "slack_notifier_name": "<string>",
  "rewards": [
    {
      "id": "<string>",
      "name": "<string>",
      "description": "<string>",
      "points_required": <int>
    }
  ]
}
```

| Name                  | Type   | Required | Description |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `data_dir`            | string | Yes      | Directory holding the ledger, `<data_dir>/loyalty.json`. It is the only record of everyone's points, so pick a path that survives module upgrades and back it up. Created if missing. |
| `rewards`             | list   | No       | Rewards customers can fund. `id` keys the recorded contributions, so keep it stable — renaming it orphans what was put in. `name` and `points_required` (> 0) are required; `description` is optional. Raising a funded reward's `points_required` above what it holds reopens it. |
| `slack_notifier_name` | string | No       | A `viam:notifications:slack` service that announces each reward as it becomes fully funded, listing every contributor. If it is configured but unavailable the CRM still runs, without announcements. |
### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "data_dir": "/data/crm",
  "slack_notifier_name": "slack",
  "rewards": [
    { "id": "grinder", "name": "Better grinder", "description": "Burrs that don't squeak.", "points_required": 200 },
    { "id": "oat-milk", "name": "Oat milk in the fridge", "points_required": 50 }
  ]
}
```

### DoCommand

**`get_rewards`** — Every reward's progress, and with `{"email": ...}` that customer's account. `true` alone returns just the rewards.

```json
{ "get_rewards": { "email": "alice@example.com" } }
```

Returns (`funded_at` is empty until funded; `contributors` is largest first):

```json
{
  "account": { "email": "alice@example.com", "points": 7, "earned": 12, "contributed": 5 },
  "rewards": [
    {
      "id": "grinder",
      "name": "Better grinder",
      "description": "Burrs that don't squeak.",
      "points_required": 200,
      "contributed": 45,
      "remaining": 155,
      "funded": false,
      "funded_at": "",
      "contributors": [{ "email": "bob@example.com", "points": 40 }, { "email": "alice@example.com", "points": 5 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**`contribute_points`** — Move points from a customer's balance to a reward. Only what the reward still needs is taken, so `contributed` in the reply can be less than asked. Fails when the reward is unknown or already funded, or the customer doesn't have the points.

```json
{ "contribute_points": { "email": "alice@example.com", "reward_id": "grinder", "points": 5 } }
```

Returns `{"contributed": 5, "account": {...}, "reward": {...}, "funded": false}`; `funded` is `true` only on the contribution that unlocked the reward.

**`credit_points`** — Give points to an email. The coffee service sends one per completed drink; use it by hand to backfill orders made before loyalty was on. Takes one credit or a list. `reason` defaults to `"manual"`. An entry with an `order_id` that was already credited is skipped, so a backfill can be re-run safely. Every entry of a list is validated before any is applied.

```json
{
  "credit_points": [
    { "email": "alice@example.com", "points": 1, "order_id": "3f1c…", "reason": "backfill" },
    { "email": "bob@example.com", "points": 4, "reason": "backfill" }
  ]
}
```

A single credit returns `{"credited": true, "account": {...}}`; a list returns `{"credited": 1, "skipped": 1, "results": [...]}`.

`Status()` returns `{"rewards": [...]}` in the same shape as `get_rewards`.

> **Trust:** the CRM believes the email it is sent. viam-server verifies each caller but doesn't tell modules who the caller is, so the rewards page reads the viewer's email from their own Viam access token and sends that. Anyone who can issue DoCommands on the machine can credit or spend any email's points.

## Model: `viam:beanjamin:chore-wheel`

**API:** `rdk:service:generic`

The machine has upkeep that isn't the arm's job — the ice maker, the table, the claws — and this service posts to Slack who has which of it this week. It is the paper chore wheel: names on an inner disc, chores on an outer ring, turned one notch every Monday.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "slack_notifier_name": "<string>",
  "people": ["<string>"],
  "chores": ["<string>"]
}
```

| Name                  | Type   | Required | Description |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `slack_notifier_name` | string | Yes      | A [`viam:notifications:slack`](https://github.com/viam-modules/notifications) generic service the wheel is posted through. |
| `people`              | list   | Yes      | The roster, in wheel order — at least 2 distinct names. Append newcomers at the end (see "The roster order is the wheel" below). |
| `chores`              | list   | Yes      | The chores to hand out each week — at least 1, no duplicates. Any count works. |

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "slack_notifier_name": "slack",
  "people": ["Vijay", "Nicolas P", "Julie", "Daniel", "Cheuk", "Ale"],
  "chores": [
    "Cleaning the ice maker",
    "Cleaning the table",
    "Tightening the claws",
    "Cleaning the cleaner brushes",
    "Cleaning the milk bottle"
  ]
}
```

The message reads:

```
🎡 Chore wheel — week of Sep 21

• Cleaning the ice maker — Nicolas P
• Cleaning the table — Julie
• Tightening the claws — Daniel
• Cleaning the cleaner brushes — Cheuk
• Cleaning the milk bottle — Ale
• free week — Vijay
```

### DoCommand

**`send_weekly_chores`** - Post this week's chore assignments to Slack. Normally fired every Monday by viam-server's job manager (see "Scheduling" below).

```json
{"send_weekly_chores": true}
```

Pass an object with a date to read the wheel for a different week — how you preview next Monday, or check what last Monday should have said — without waiting for it:

```json
{"send_weekly_chores": {"date": "2026-10-05"}}
```

Returns `{"sent": true, "week": N, "<chore>": "<person>", ...}`.

`Status()` returns this week's assignment, `{"week": N, "<chore>": "<person>", ...}`, without posting it.

### How the wheel turns

**Any number of chores works.** Fewer chores than people leaves free weeks — six people and five chores means one person is off each week. More chores than people sends the wheel round again, so some people draw two that week. Either way every chore is assigned every week.

**The rotation is a function of the calendar, not of state.** Person *i* draws slot `(i − week) mod n` and every *n*-th slot after it, where the slots are the chores padded with free weeks to a whole number of turns, and `week` counts Mondays since a fixed epoch. So over one cycle — one week per person — everyone does every chore exactly once and takes the same number of free weeks, and there is nothing to persist: a module restart, a redeploy, or running the command twice in one morning all read the same wheel. The cost is that the order is predictable to anyone who works it out; the benefit is that nobody can draw the ice maker three weeks running.

**The roster order is the wheel.** `people` is the order around the disc and the order in the message. Reordering it, or inserting someone in the middle, reshuffles who has what this week — append new people at the end. Removing someone shortens the cycle and likewise reshuffles.

### Scheduling

Scheduling lives in the machine config, exactly as for the coffee service's [daily digest](#daily-order-summary-in-slack):

```
"jobs": [
  {
    "name": "weekly-chore-wheel",
    "schedule": "CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 9 * * 1",
    "resource": "chore-wheel",
    "method": "DoCommand",
    "command": { "send_weekly_chores": true }
  }
]
```

The digest's `CRON_TZ=` caveat applies here too, with one wrinkle of its own: the week number comes from the calendar *date* in the timezone the command runs in. A job firing at 9am New York and a hand-run at 9am London on the same Monday agree; a hand-run late Sunday evening in New York is still last week. Fire it on Mondays and none of this matters.

---

## Development

When iterating on poses, we recommend using the built-in `viam` CLI motion commands to query and test arm positions on a running machine.

Note: `--organization` , `--location`, and `--machine` will be infered from the part ID

### Print motion service status

```bash
viam robot part motion print-status \
  --organization <org> \
  --location <location> \
  --machine <machine> \
  --part <part>
```

### Get the current pose of a component

```bash
viam robot part motion get-pose \
  --organization <org> \
  --location <location> \
  --machine <machine> \
  --part <part> \
  --component <component-name>
```

### Move a component to a pose

```bash
viam robot part motion set-pose \
  --organization <org> \
  --location <location> \
  --machine <machine> \
  --part <part> \
  --component <component-name> \
  -x <mm> -y <mm> -z <mm> \
  --ox <float> --oy <float> --oz <float> --theta <degrees>
```

Note: Only the pose values specified will be modified. Example if you only set `-x 100`, it will move the component by just changing the X value of its current pose

Once you've found the right poses, add them to your `multi-poses-execution-switch` configuration.

The web app's calibration view at `?view=calibrate` lists which poses belong to which frame on a given machine, and which of them are set by hand rather than derived from another pose. It also polls the live `filter` / `grip-point` / `cam` positions off the running machine and offers each as a copyable pose, so the jog-read-paste loop doesn't need the CLI. The pose list comes from a manifest generated from the machines' live app config — regenerate it with `make web-app-manifest` whenever a pose is added, removed, renamed, or re-baselined.

### Motion planning timeout

Every plan the coffee service makes — direct move, pivot, circular, no-spill
carry, and each step of the fridge-door sweep — is capped at **15 seconds**
(`motionPlanTimeout` in `coffee/motion.go`), as is each
`multi-poses-execution-switch` `SetPosition` move. RDK's own default is 300s,
which makes a plan that will never succeed indistinguishable from one still
searching, and holds the brew cycle open long past the point where the drink is
worth serving.

A plan that overruns fails with `motion planning failed (<label>, after
<duration>)`, and every successful plan logs `planned <label> in <duration>`, so
the logs say which it was. A timeout is almost always an unreachable goal rather
than a planner that needed longer; if a legitimately hard plan starts hitting the
cap, raise the constant rather than working around it per call site.

### List recent orders

`order_sensor_name` writes one reading per order attempt, which makes the recent
brew history queryable without opening the data page:

```bash
make orders LIMIT=20
```

```
#  When (UTC)        Result     Drink       Customer  Dur    Failed step     Order ID
-  ----------------  ---------  ----------  --------  -----  --------------  ------------------------------------
1  2026-09-04 13:16  OK         espresso    —         202s                   aee279d8-fc5f-4d2b-934c-50c8c0037108

3 OK · 1 failed · 1 operator-cancelled
```

Rows are in brew order, oldest first, so `#` reads as the sequence the machine
actually ran. An order that isn't `order_ok` is split into **FAILED** (a genuine
fault) and **CANCELLED** (an operator stopped it). A `—` customer is an order
placed outside the kiosk, which has no name attached. Sub-second durations are
printed in milliseconds rather than rounded to `0s`, since the instant failures
are usually the interesting ones.

Copy an order ID straight into `fetch-order`:

```bash
make orders LIMIT=50 ORDERS_FLAGS="--errors"
make fetch-order ORDER=<the id from that table>
```

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--limit` | How many of the most recent orders to show. Defaults to 20. |
| `--errors` | Print each unsuccessful order's `error_message` under its row. |
| `--newest-first` | List newest first instead of in brew order. Drops the `#` column, which would otherwise count backwards. |
| `--part-id` | Only show orders from one machine part. Defaults to every part in the org. |
| `--org-id` | Viam organization to query. Defaults to `$VIAM_ORG_ID`, else the `viam-dev` org the beanjamin machines live in. |
| `--viam` | Path to the `viam` CLI binary. Defaults to `viam` on `PATH`. |

This reads the sensor's tabular data through `viam data query tabular mql`. It
has to be **MQL, not SQL** — `viam data query tabular sql` cannot resolve the
nested `data.readings.*` paths the readings live under.

### Fetch one order's data

Every plan the module makes while `save_motion_requests_dir` is set is synced to
the data page tagged with its order ID, step, motion type, and planning outcome
(see the `save_motion_requests_dir` row above). To pull one order's plans down
for offline debugging:

```bash
make fetch-order ORDER=5fb95a4c-83f8-4e66-862d-52cbca842ed5
```

That shells out to `viam data export binary filter --tags <order-id>` (so a
logged-in `viam` CLI is required), then flattens the export's `tag=` directory
tree into a single `./<order-id>/` directory, renaming each file to
`<index>-<timestamp>-<step>-<motion>-<outcome>.json`. One order is roughly 70
plans / 80 MB, and the directories are gitignored:

```
5fb95a4c-83f8-4e66-862d-52cbca842ed5/
  001-20260903_141523.123-locking_portafilter-move-success.json
  002-20260903_141527.880-locking_portafilter-carry-success.json
  003-20260903_141602.410-grinding-circular-success.json
  004-20260903_141640.005-brewing-move-failure.json
```

The timestamp is the machine's **local** clock, not UTC, so these names do not
line up directly with the UTC times in the `order-events` sensor readings. The
leading index makes alphabetical order execution order, so the directory reads
top-to-bottom as the order's motion history.

Each file round-trips through RDK's `ReadRequestAndResponseFromFile`, which means
**two concatenated JSON documents** per file — the request (`frame_system`,
`goals`, `start_state`, `obstacles_in_world_frame`, `constraints`,
`planner_options`) followed by the response (`path`, `trajectory`), absent when
planning failed. Plain `jq .` fails on them with "Extra data"; use `jq -s` to
read the pair as an array.

Add `WITH_VIDEO=1` for the camera clips, pass other flags through
`FETCH_FLAGS`, or call the CLI directly:

```bash
make fetch-order ORDER=<order-id> WITH_VIDEO=1
go run ./cmd/cli fetch-order --help
go run ./cmd/cli fetch-order --out /tmp --with-video <order-id>
```

| Flag           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--out`        | Parent directory to create `<order-id>/` in. Defaults to the working directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--from`       | Reorganize an export destination you already downloaded instead of downloading again. Copies rather than moves, leaving your export tree intact.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--with-video` | Also download the order's three camera clips (~130 MB of mp4). They share the order's tag but aren't plan requests, so the export asks only for `application/json` unless this is set. Clips keep the names the video store gave them (which embed a `{"order_id": ...}` blob) and sort after the numbered plans. |
| `--viam`       | Path to the `viam` CLI binary. Defaults to `viam` on `PATH`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--timeout`    | Seconds to allow the export. `0` (the default) leaves the `viam` CLI's own default in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Note that `viam data export binary` **exits 0 having downloaded nothing** when the
account can't read the machine's location, so a missing order and a missing
permission look alike from the outside. The command turns that into a
`no data found for order <id>` error rather than reporting success, and leaves no
directory behind. A truncated order ID looks identical from the outside, so check
it is a full UUID (8-4-4-4-**12**) first.

### Brightness shadow

The shipping measurement finds the ice surface as a *brightness step* — dark
empty glass above, bright ice below — because a step survives a lighting change
where an absolute cutoff does not. The cost is a dead band: the step needs a
full `ice_contrast_window` of rows either side of a candidate, so it can only
name rows `ice_stop_row_px` to `ice_roi_y1 - window` (595-622 at the defaults).
A surface above the stop row is unnameable, which is why the dispense stops on
the surface *disappearing* rather than on a row.

An absolute cutoff has no dead band, but it is exactly what a lighting change
breaks. Set `ice_brightness_thresh` and it runs as a **shadow**: the same
frames, read both ways, with only the contrast step deciding anything. Each
watched dispense logs its first sighting, when its own stop test
(`row <= ice_stop_row_px`) would have fired, and a closing comparison;
differences in kind bump `ice_shadow_disagreements`, timing gaps do not. Nothing
about the pin changes, so it is safe to leave on.

Pick the threshold first: `check_ice_level` prints the range of row brightness
it sees, and the cutoff has to sit above an empty glass's brightest row and
below ice's dimmest. 132 is the midpoint on the committed fixtures under one
lighting condition — a seed, not a value.

### Annotated frames

Every dispense inside an order saves the drawn frame under
`tag=<order-id>/tag=ice_dispense/tag=ice_<outcome>/`; a hand-run action saves one
only with `annotate: true`, and without an order ID to nest under. Outcome is
`stopped`, `timeout`, `surface_cap`, `vision_fallback`, `cancelled` or `check`.
Under a
data-synced capture dir the data manager tags the upload from those segments, so
frames filter on the data page by order and by how the run ended, like the
motion-plan requests. `vision_fallback` and `cancelled` save the last frame that
measured cleanly, captioned with its age.

Rows grow downward, so a surface drawn *above* the stop row is a full glass —
which is why the step reports nothing there and the shadow reports a row. A log
line says the stop row was reached; only the picture says whether it still
matches how that glass was gripped.

**To tune a stop row**: glass in the jaws, `move_to_ice_dispense` with
`with_glass: true`, then `check_ice_level` with `annotate: true` as often as you
like. No ice spent, a drawn frame each time.
