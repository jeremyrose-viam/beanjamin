# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository overview

`viam:beanjamin` is a Viam module that automates a Viam OK-1 arm to prepare espresso. The repo ships two deployables:

- A Go **Viam module** (`cmd/module/main.go`) registering eight models — see `meta.json` and `README.md` for the full list and per-model configuration docs. The headline model is `viam:beanjamin:coffee` (generic service) which orchestrates the full brew cycle.
- A Next.js **web app** (`web-app/`) that exposes the customer-facing ordering UI and talks to the machine via `@viamrobotics/sdk`. Packaged as its own Viam module via `web-app-module`.
- A **CLI** (`cmd/cli/`) for reading a machine's brew history off the data page — `make orders` and `make fetch-order`, documented in the README's Development section.

Each model lives in its own package. The coffee service is `coffee/` (`package coffee`), whose files split by concern:

| Concern | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle and command API | `module.go`, `config.go`, `api.go` (DoCommand dispatch, `Status`), `operator.go` (proceed, clear_queue, reset_world, cancel, cancel_order), `actions.go` (`execute_action`), `cup_flow.go` (`run_cup_flow`) |
| Brew cycle | `prepare.go` (`prepareDrink` and its fault pause), `steps.go` (`Step`, `runSteps`/`executeStep`, step labels and `setStep`), `brew_steps.go`, `poses.go` (pose and frame names, startup pose validation), `order_intake.go`, `queue.go` |
| Serving and drink variants | `serving.go`, `serving_slots.go`, `iced.go`, `milk.go`, `door.go` |
| Motion planning | `motion.go`, `flow.go` (during an order, the order goroutine plans moves and hands them, with gripper actions and waits, to an execution goroutine; it settles at stopping points), `held_geometry.go`, `collisions.go`, `joints.go`, `glass_relative_poses.go` (pour poses resolved against the staged glass), `handle_relative_pose.go` (the filter release and re-grab resolved against the locked portafilter handle) |
| Vision-driven pickup | `cup_pickup.go`, `gripper_state.go`, `detection_snapshot.go` |
| Peripheral integrations | `slack_notify.go`, `daily_summary.go`, `sensor_usage.go`, `delivery.go` (cart heartbeat, dock, and handover), `delivery_slots.go` (placing a delivery drink directly in the docked cart's AprilTag-marked slots), `keepalive.go` (purge loop), `keepalive_config.go` (`KeepAlive` and its window) |
| Order model (`coffee/order/`, `package order`) | `order.go` (`Order`), `queue.go` (`Queue`), `request.go` (`prepare_order` decoding), `drinks.go` (drink catalog and `Menu`), `reading.go` (`Reading` for the order sensor) |
| Speech (`coffee/speech/`, `package speech`) | `phrases.go` (spoken line tables and pickers), `speaker.go` (`Speaker`, `say_async` to the speech service), `fault_alarm.go` (`FaultAlarm`, the `fault_active` flag and failure line) |
| Slack reports (`coffee/report/`, `package report`) | `notifier.go` (`Notifier`, the one Slack send path), `failure.go` (failed-order alert), `daily_summary.go` (order digest), `links.go` (app.viam.com deep-links) |
| Camera clips (`coffee/clips/`, `package clips`) | `saver.go` (`Saver`: per-order clip saves through the video-store multiplexer, pending-clip records, and the `cleanup_pending_clips` recovery sweep) |
| Ice vision (`coffee/icevision/`, `package icevision`) | `detector.go` (`Detector` over the arm camera, `Params`), `level.go` (contrast-step surface measurement, `check_ice_level`), `brightness.go` (brightness shadow), `annotate.go` and `dispense_frame.go` (annotated ice frames saved under `save_motion_requests_dir`); the dwell loop that drives the ice pin is `coffee/ice_dwell.go`, which calls into it |
| Spatial math (`coffee/geom/`, `package geom`) | `pickup.go` (`Candidate`, centroid merge/rank and the per-centroid container box (`ContainerCandidates`), `PoseRelativeTo`, `CameraToWorldPose`, `ContainerBox`), `shelf.go` (`ShelfTileCenters`, `SlotIndex`), `surface.go` (`SurfaceBox`, `WorldAnchoredSurfaceBoxes`, `SurfaceTopZUnder`); pure functions with no service state, called from `cup_pickup.go`, `serving_slots.go`, `serving.go`, `held_geometry.go`, `glass_relative_poses.go` and `door.go` |

`coffee/order`, `coffee/speech`, `coffee/report`, `coffee/clips`, `coffee/icevision`, and `coffee/geom` depend on nothing in `coffee`, so they must never import it. The other models are sibling packages: `ordersensor/`, `maintenancesensor/`, `customerdetector/`, `crm/`, `chorewheel/`, `dialcontrolmotion/`, `multiposesexecutionswitch/`. `crm/` (`viam:beanjamin:crm`) holds customer profiles keyed by email — today the loyalty ledger (`ledger.go`: points credited per completed drink, pooled toward configured rewards) and its DoCommands (`crm.go`, plus `recap.go` for the Slack rewards recap); the coffee service only calls its `credit_points`, through `crm_name` (`creditLoyaltyPoint` in `coffee/queue.go`). `chorewheel/` (`viam:beanjamin:chore-wheel`) posts the weekly maintenance rota to Slack through `report.Notifier`; it is independent of the coffee service (`wheel.go` is the rotation and message, `chorewheel.go` the service). There is no top-level Go package; `cmd/module/main.go` registers every model.

## Common commands

Go module (run from repo root):

```bash
make                  # build bin/beanjamin (default target)
make test             # go test ./...
make lint             # gofmt -s -w . && golangci-lint run
make module.tar.gz    # package for Viam (use `make module` to run tests first)
make setup            # install nlopt (brew on macOS, apt on Linux) + go mod download
```

Run a single Go test:

```bash
go test ./... -run TestName
go test ./coffee -run TestEnqueueOrder   # coffee package
go test ./customerdetector -run TestFoo  # subpackage
```

Web app (run from `web-app/`):

```bash
npm ci                # install (matches Makefile's web-app-install)
npm run dev           # next dev
npm run build         # next build (static export into web-app/out)
npm run lint          # eslint
```

Build the bundled web-app Viam module from repo root: `make web-app-module` (runs `npm run build` + builds `cmd/web-app` Go launcher).

## Architecture

### Coffee service lifecycle

`prepareDrink` in `coffee/prepare.go` is the core orchestrator. An order flows:

1. `DoCommand{"prepare_order": ...}` enqueues an `order.Order` into the `order.Queue` (`coffee/order/queue.go`); `enqueueOrder` in `coffee/order_intake.go` validates it.
2. A background queue consumer (`beanjaminCoffee.processQueue`, `coffee/queue.go`) pops one order at a time and invokes `prepareDrink`.
3. `prepareDrink` advances through 9 phases, each run by its `runPhase` closure, which publishes the step label (visible through `get_queue` and the order sensor) and opens a trace span. The phases are small methods (`grindCoffee`, `tampGround`, `brew`, `cleanPortafilter`, etc. in `coffee/brew_steps.go`) that each execute a list of `Step` structs through `executeStep` (`coffee/steps.go`), which drives the motion layer in `coffee/motion.go`.
4. On completion/failure, the order is moved to `recent` for `order.RecentDisplayDuration` (15s) so the UI can render "Ready!" without diffing polls.
5. A single reading per attempt is pushed to the optional order-sensor sink (`ordersensor/`, discovered from deps through the `orderSensorSink` interface in `coffee/queue.go`), and an async clip save is requested on the optional `cam_storage_mux_name` video-store multiplexer.

`cancel`, `clear_queue`, and `proceed` (`coffee/operator.go`) manipulate the same state. Only one routine runs at a time: `s.lease` (`armLease` in `coffee/arm_lease.go`) keeps the holder's name, the pause and the shared `cancelCtx` under one `mu`. Troubleshooting commands take the arm with `claimManual`, which ignores the pause; the order queue (before it starts each order) and the keepalive purge use `claimAutomated`, which is refused while paused. A claim hands back `cancelCtx` in the same step so cancellation can interrupt motion; `release` gives the arm back.

### Motion layer

`coffee/motion.go` wraps Viam's motion-planning APIs. Poses are resolved through `multi-poses-execution-switch` components (one for the filter, one for the claws, configured via `pose_switcher_name` / `claws_pose_switcher_name`). Each `Step` declares a pose name, optional linear constraint, optional circular motion (used for grinding/cleaning), and optional allowed collisions for contact phases.

Every plan goes through `planMotion` (which also persists the request/response pair and tags planning failures with `errMotionPlanning`) and, for the paths that execute straight away, `planTrajectory`. Put anything that must apply to all four motion kinds — direct move, pivot, circular, no-spill carry — there rather than in the individual callers. `save_motion_requests_dir`, if set, dumps motion-request JSON per plan for offline debugging.

### Config pattern

All models follow the standard Viam `Validate`/`newX` pattern — see `coffee/config.go` for the coffee service's `Config`, and the sibling model packages (e.g. `dialcontrolmotion/`) for simpler examples. When adding a new tunable, follow the `BrewTimeSec` / `GrindTimeSec` pattern: add a `float64` field with `omitempty`, add a small helper on `beanjaminCoffee` that returns the configured value or a default constant defined near the feature's code.

### Web app

`web-app/app/page.tsx` is a thin view selector: it renders the **fleet dashboard** (`web-app/app/dashboard.tsx`, with `web-app/app/home/` components — a machine list with a per-machine status dot and queue summary, order charts, and leaderboards) or the single-machine **kiosk** (`web-app/app/kiosk.tsx`, with `web-app/app/order/` components — `welcome` → `drink` → `name` → `face-register` → `confirmation`, with a right-rail `order-tracker`; `welcome` also leads to `profile`, where a customer reviews and deletes the face photos they are recognised by and adds more through the same `face-register` capture flow) based on the `?view=` query param (`?view=machine` selects the kiosk; `?view=rewards` selects `web-app/app/rewards.tsx`, the loyalty page, which reads the viewer's email from their Viam access token and sends it to the `crm` service). Everything is served from one static entrypoint, so the kiosk can't have its own route — a refresh on a nested path would 404. `web-app/app/lib/viamClient.ts` wraps the Viam TS SDK and is where `DoCommand`s are issued against the coffee and customer-detector services. Connection lifecycle helpers live in `web-app/app/lib/connectionManager.ts`: `withTimeout`/`disconnectQuietly` (the dial-timeout and teardown primitives) plus `createConnectionManager`, a per-machine connection pool with in-flight dedup that the dashboard uses (one pooled connection per machine). `useViamConnection.ts` is the kiosk's single connection — it dials directly with those shared helpers and runs a heartbeat, without the pool. The tracker polls `get_queue` to render step state and ready-to-pick-up cards; the dashboard polls each machine and colors its status dot green (coffee service answering), yellow (reachable but coffee service absent), or gray (offline). Below the chart, `home/orders-panel.tsx` renders one `Panel` at a time — today's orders across every machine (open by default), one machine-day picked off the chart, or the last 7 days of errors — each row expanding to its camera clips, which are matched to the order by data tag plus a `video/mp4` mime filter (the order ID also tags every saved motion-plan JSON).

## Lint and style

`.golangci.yml` disables several staticcheck rules — most notably `ST1005` (capitalized errors are fine, e.g. "Google") and `ST1003` (snake_case identifiers are tolerated). Always run `make lint` before committing Go changes; it runs `gofmt -s -w .` in place.

## Conventions

- **Pose work**: when iterating on arm poses, use `viam robot part motion get-pose` / `set-pose` against a running machine (see the README "Development" section) rather than guessing coordinates; commit new poses into the `multi-poses-execution-switch` config only after verifying them physically.
- **Ordered steps carry labels**: when editing `prepareDrink`, keep `setStep("...")` in sync with the numbered `logger.Infof("step N/9: ...")` — both surface to the UI and the tracker collapses/expands based on the raw label.
- **Config docs live in `README.md`**: when you add or rename a `Config` field, update the corresponding model section in `README.md` so operators have an accurate reference.
